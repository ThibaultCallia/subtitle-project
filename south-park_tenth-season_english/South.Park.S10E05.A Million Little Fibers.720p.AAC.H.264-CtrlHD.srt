1
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:39,164
Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's.

2
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,969
How spicy would you like me
to make your Chang sauce?

3
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,579
Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.

4
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,260
I know. I'm swamped.

5
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:48,843
I've got no help here!
- Well what about the new waiter?

6
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:52,480
The new waiter is useless.
And, I think he's high.

7
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,765
How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?

8
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:58,835
Will you just place our order, please?

9
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:02,241
Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

10
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:03,579
Everything okay here?

11
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:07,602
Fine, except this towel has been mixing
Chang sauce for fifteen minutes.

12
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:08,769
He's clueless!

13
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:11,837
Don't call me shoeless!
You're shoeless!

14
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,159
Yeah? Well you're a towel!
- You're a towel!

15
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,722
All right, that's it! Get out of here!
You're fired!

16
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:17,832
Yeah!

17
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:19,498
Not him, you!

18
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:20,860
Awww.

19
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:25,905
Aw man, I really screwed up this time.

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,506
The rent's due at the end of the month
and I don't have any money.

21
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:32,266
I need to shape up
and find a new job, quick.

22
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,977
But first, maybe I'll get a little high.

23
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:45,232
Wait. Here it goes.
Good ideas comin'.

24
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:48,797
Yeah. Hey yeah!
I should become a writer!

25
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:50,879
If I just write a book about my life.

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,950
I can get it published and then make
plenty of money to pay rent.

27
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,289
I bet people can't wait to read my memoirs.

28
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:08,350
A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS
By
Toweleeeie

29
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,584
This is a really good idea...

30
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:25,360
Aha. Mmm. Yes. Yes, I see.
Well, that's quite a fascinating story,

31
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:30,155
you being engineered as a towel with
a computer chip that determines dryness.

32
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:32,287
Yep! And it's all true.

33
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:37,305
Chapters 4 through 8, however,
seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips.

34
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:41,202
I guess I could edit those chapters down some.

35
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,512
Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir,
but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs.

36
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:48,234
Huh?
Why not?

37
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:50,747
Well, just the small trivial fact that...

38
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:54,331
people aren't interested
in autobiographies of towels.

39
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:57,913
Wull yeah, but, maybe people
will read my memoirs and like

40
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:00,164
apply its lessons to their own lives.

41
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,539
No. They won't.
Because they're people.

42
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,081
And you're a towel.

43
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:07,244
You're a towel!

44
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:08,078
No.

45
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:12,385
I'm a big book publisher whi's not
the least bit interested in your stony memoirs.

46
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:13,760
You're a towel.

47
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,431
Now what am I gonna do?

48
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:23,653
I gotta pay rent and I just wasted
three weeks writin' my memoirs.

49
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:27,442
It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible.

50
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,039
I've gotta shape up, focus, an come up
with real solutions to my problems.

51
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:36,415
I'd better get a little high.
Oh, maybe I shouldn't.

52
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:41,304
But you have to think of somethin' fast,
an' gettin' high makes you smart.

53
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,343
All right, I'll just use my special
gettin'-high powers one more time.

54
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,985
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course!
That's it! Why didn't I think of it before?

55
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,324
“A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS”

56
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,575
Chapter One

57
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:09,505
All my life I've been a pretty
irresponsible towel... person.

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:17,707
I thought I was somehow stronger
and more immune than other towels... people.

59
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:20,899
This is a really good idea.

60
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:30,733
Ogh. Oh my God. Uh I could not believe a human
being has led this kind of life, Mr...!

61
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,518
McTowelie.
Steven McTowelie.

62
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,371
It's heartbreaking passages like this one:

63
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:41,088
"I am a person who often gets hung out
to dry by all those around me."

64
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:43,654
I know this company would
be honored to publish this book.

65
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:48,971
I just have one small question first.
You're not... a towel, are you?

66
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:56,181
No. If I was a towel, why would I be
wearing this hat, an' this fake mustache?

67
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:57,753
Right, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,336
Well Steven, if it's all right with you,

69
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:01,587
I'm gonna to get our agents
and lawyers on the phone right now.

70
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,800
We're in business, sir.
- Allright!

71
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:11,624
Thank you so much.

72
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:17,168
Once in a while I come across
a book that is sooo honest

73
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,891
and sooo moving that it changes my life.

74
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:27,807
"A Million Little Fibers" is the true story
about a man who was born in a laboratory.

75
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:32,060
Please welcome author Steven McTowelie!

76
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:39,202
Steven, when I read your book,
I thought to myself,

77
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:44,728
"How can a human being go through
all this and still turn out okay?"

78
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:48,764
Well, I guess I'm just
an extra-special tow- person.

79
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:53,139
You talk in your book how you would sometimes
have to spend days hung up on a rack.

80
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:55,519
What would that do to you emotionally?

81
00:05:55,626 --> 00:06:01,736
You have been through... so much and I think
that people all over America could benefit...

82
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:06,649
Oh God, there she goes again,
babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on.

83
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:09,538
She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!

84
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:12,510
A life that kept getting up
whenever it was down.

85
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:15,174
Nobody knows what it's
like to be Oprah's minge.

86
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:19,431
All she does is work, never gives
her ol' minge a nice rub now and again.

87
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:23,335
A minge needs attention!
At least a scratch once in a while!

88
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:25,974
Well Steven, your book hasn't
sold a lot of copies yet,

89
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:28,376
but I have some pretty exciting news for you!

90
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:31,390
Used to be a time when Oprah
would play with me night and day.

91
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,100
She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger.

92
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,642
Now I just sit here, in the dark,
not even so much as a pinky!

93
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:42,128
I should write a book!
Be much more depressin' than his!

94
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:47,902
And so, Steven, I'm making your book my
official Book of the Month selection!

95
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:48,932
Really?

96
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,154
Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.

97
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:22,248
Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can
get her in as a guest on the 19th.

98
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:25,537
All right, is John Travolta available
to be a guest the week after that?

99
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,620
Okay, that might work better
since it's Sweeps Week.

100
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,776
Can't take it anymore.
All she ever does is work work work,

101
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,434
never pays attention to the ol' minge.
I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits.

102
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:39,934
I want attention!
I'm bloody bored!

103
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,545
Oh stop your complainin'!
I'm tryin' to sleep back here.

104
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:46,919
Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?
- Yes it's me.

105
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,460
You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't
paid any attention to me in years.

106
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:56,996
Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole.
I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.

107
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,765
Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard!

108
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:02,402
I want to travel.
I want to see Paris.

109
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:06,221
I thought lamp was goin' to get better,
but Oprah's always busy.

110
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:09,074
Werkin' and werkin', diyatin'
and not diyatin'.

111
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:12,713
I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake
or teaspoons of weedgrass.

112
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,171
She's a a workaholic.

113
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,392
Let's face it:

114
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:18,813
The only way we're ever goin' tuh get any
attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.

115
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,103
Well that'll never happen.

116
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:22,797
Not unless she gets fired.

117
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:24,666
Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?

118
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:28,378
That bloke on the show today,
the one Oprah supported.

119
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:32,044
'E isn't a bloke at all.
'E's a towel.

120
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,728
Ooo. How d'you know?

121
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:36,436
I'm a minge.
Minges know a towel when they hear one.

122
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:41,822
If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion
author is a towel, she'll look right foolish.

123
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,280
Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.

124
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:47,363
'Ow do we get proof?
- We get somebody else to do it.

125
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:50,499
The greatest investigator reporter of our time.

126
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:54,735
Mr. Rivera.
- What is it, Dimitri?

127
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,653
There's somebody on the phone to speak with you.

128
00:08:56,654 --> 00:09:00,363
He says he has inside information for you
that may discredit Oprah Winfrey.

129
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:05,666
Thith ith Geraldo.
- 'Allo 'Eraldo.

130
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:08,981
I've got some information for
you ya might find interestin'.

131
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,746
It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.

132
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,204
Who am I thpeaking with?!
- 'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.

133
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,573
Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah.

134
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,781
You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?

135
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:22,540
What information do you have?

136
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:25,684
What'd 'e say?
- He wants to know what information we have.

137
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,009
Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary!
Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"!

138
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:32,551
Stop wastin' my time.
- Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!

139
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,679
I didn't say "stop wastin' my time",
Geraldo did.

140
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,967
What ith going on here?!

141
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:40,528
Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'.
Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk.

142
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,765
Hallo?
- Who ith thith?

143
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:47,737
This is Gary.
- Gary who?! What is your last name?!

144
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,411
Don't give away your name.
We don't want anyone to know where we are.

145
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:54,911
A'right, look. All you need to know is
that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.

146
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:58,161
Aw you stupid twit!
- Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!

147
00:09:58,216 --> 00:10:00,383
He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!

148
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,697
Now just tell 'im this:

149
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:07,601
The writer of the book on Oprah's
Book of the Month Club is a phonih.

150
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:10,762
He's not a person at all.
He's a towel.

151
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
A towel?

152
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,900
A talking towel?
That doethn't make any sense.

153
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,431
Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised
at things that can talk.

154
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,223
You'd be surprised at things that can talk.

155
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:22,223
What proof do you have of this accusation?!

156
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:25,557
Just look into the author
of "A Million Little Fiyabers"

157
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,306
and you'll discover the truth.

158
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:29,103
And how do I go about that?

159
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:32,054
Hello?
Hello?!

160
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,560
This is Larry King Live.

161
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,331
My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie,

162
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:42,096
author of the acclaimed book,
"A Million Little Fibers".

163
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:43,762
How are you tonight, Steven?

164
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:46,262
Well Larry, I'm a little high.

165
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,714
Your book has helped
a lot of people beat addiction.

166
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,812
What made you write it?

167
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:53,645
Well Larry, I was really just
writin' down my memoirs as I-

168
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:54,965
What?
What's that?

169
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:58,672
Oh ex- oh excuse me, Steven, I understand
that we have a special report coming in.

170
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:02,273
Joining us live from Afghanistan,
here is Geraldo Rivera.

171
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,312
Hello?
Larry, are you receiving me?

172
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:08,674
We're here, Geraldo.
You're live on the show.

173
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:12,740
Larry, this brave reporter has been
days investigating and researching

174
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,017
and I have come up with a shocking discovery

175
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:18,629
that is going to rock the balls
and ass of the literary world!

176
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:21,997
Steven McTowelie,
author of "A Million Little Fibers"

177
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:23,816
Is a towel!

178
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:26,191
You're a towel.

179
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,260
No, you're a towel.

180
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:30,253
Well you're a beaner towel.

181
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,552
What did you say?

182
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,766
I'm sorry.
I'm high.

183
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,677
This looks pretty bad, Oprah.

184
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:38,859
Your fans look to you
to be all-knowing and all-seeing

185
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:42,248
and you've just spent two weeks
supporting a lying racist towel.

186
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:43,984
'E did it, Gary!

187
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:45,706
'Eraldo got the proof!

188
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,762
Oprah's got egg all over her face!

189
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:49,401
She'll have to retire!

190
00:11:49,464 --> 00:11:51,568
It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary.

191
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:55,360
Without 'er career 'o worry about,
Oprah's sure to travel the world!

192
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:57,457
Enjoy the finer things in life!

193
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:58,798
She'll spend hours just...

194
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:00,277
playin' with 'er own minge!

195
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:02,068
And her Gary too.

196
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,596
Sure. And 'er Gary.

197
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:04,707
We did it, mate!

198
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:07,346
Oprah, we need to know what we're going to do.

199
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:08,537
What's the big deal?

200
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:12,065
His book helped people.
Why does it matter than he made some stuff up?

201
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,271
Are people really going to be that mad?

202
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,045
Your book got me to give up alcohol!

203
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,980
But I thought you were a person!

204
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:28,102
Yeah, we want our money back, you dumb towel!

205
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,540
No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye?
No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye?

206
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:36,984
Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.

207
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:39,714
Hello?

208
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,608
Steven, it's Oprah.

209
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:43,840
Can you come on my show again tomorrow?

210
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:44,745
Why?

211
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:48,943
We need to tell the audience why you
changed some of the facts in your book

212
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:51,735
that you thought it necessary
to "heighten" certain things

213
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:54,597
to make the book more relevant to people.

214
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,561
Hey yeah.

215
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:59,657
Just come on the show
and explain in a very level-headed way

216
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:03,616
that changing some facts shouldn't matter
if the book helps people, okay?

217
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:04,644
Okay.

218
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:05,866
Thanks Oprah!

219
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:07,680
You're a real friend.

220
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:09,117
See you tomorrow.

221
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:12,112
All right, I got one chance here.

222
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:14,815
I need to focus and come up
with what I'm gonna say.

223
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:16,759
Maybe I should get a little high.

224
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:18,287
No! Wait a minute!

225
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:20,412
I'm not going to get high this time.

226
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:24,954
Aw, come on. You need to come up
with ideas of what to say on Oprah.

227
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,791
But, the ideas I come up with when
I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.

228
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:33,199
Yeah. That's why you
should only get a little high.

229
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,177
Well, maybe just a little high.

230
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,493
Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie

231
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:47,590
whose memoirs many of you purchased after
I made it my Book of the Month Selection.

232
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,363
Ya hear that, Gary?
Nobody's applaudin'!

233
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:55,877
Yeah! They're all right pissed off!
This is great!

234
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,519
Now, it turns out that
your name isn't really Steven.

235
00:13:58,544 --> 00:14:00,217
It's Towelie, correct?

236
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,172
Yeah.

237
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:02,755
And you are a towel.

238
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:05,326
Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah.

239
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:09,527
Can you explain to the audience why
you said you weren't a towel before?

240
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,249
Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh

241
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:15,028
woo dat all like...

242
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:15,854
It's like...

243
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:20,250
Was it that you thought embellishing
the story was okay if it helped people?

244
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:22,181
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it!

245
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,955
Well you know what I think, Towelie?

246
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:27,635
I think you're a lying sack of shit!

247
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:31,893
You lied to all these people and for what?!

248
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:33,601
To make money!

249
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:36,166
They bought your book thinking it was true!

250
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:37,861
That's right!
- Yeah.

251
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:38,995
But I thought you said-

252
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:42,625
How dare you like to me
and make me look foolish?!

253
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,814
What's this?
What's she doin'?

254
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:46,786
I don't understand, Mingie.

255
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:49,467
You think writing is a joke,
you stupid towel?!

256
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,842
Yeah, you you get him, Oprah!
- Yeah!

257
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,250
You will not get away with this!

258
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:56,375
She's getting everyone back on 'er side!

259
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,028
Oh, tha' clever cow!

260
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:02,228
You lied to me, Towelie!
And therefore you have lied to America!

261
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,867
We are going to rise up against you!

262
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:06,482
Yeah!
Yeah!

263
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,492
Is this audience ready for
a good old-fashioned lynching?!

264
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,779
Yeah!

265
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:18,089
Audience, if you look under your seats,
you'll find your very own torches!

266
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:24,149
Minge, does this mean
I have to wait to see Paris?

267
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:27,246
There's not gonna be any Paris!
Don't you get it, Gary?!

268
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:29,885
The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again!

269
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,690
She'll be workin' more than ever now!

270
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:32,986
Our plan is ruined!

271
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,055
No!

272
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,513
We'll give you a five-second headstart.

273
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,027
One.
Two.

274
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:40,381
Let's get him!

275
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,680
Burn him!
Burn the towel!

276
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,449
Burn that which lies to Oprah!

277
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,487
Looks like your time is up, Towelie!

278
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,257
I've led my adoring fans right to you!

279
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:03,688
All right, Oprah!

280
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,194
I've shown my fans that... ugh!

281
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:13,398
All right!
Everyone back!

282
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:14,770
Get back I said!

283
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:21,184
What the hell is this?!

284
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,241
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!

285
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,502
Mingie, what're you doin'?

286
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,761
Gettin' ou'a here Gary!

287
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:27,800
One way or another!

288
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,402
What is going on?!

289
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:35,961
Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow
or so help me I'll blow your brains out!

290
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:38,509
I want a chooper!
You got that?!

291
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,555
And a jet waiting at the airport!

292
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,279
Mingie, have you lost your mind?

293
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:46,403
Come on, Gary!
You said you always wanted to see Paris!

294
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:50,282
Not like this, Mingie.
Not like this!

295
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:53,261
All right, gig is up.
Put down the gun!

296
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:54,479
Stay back, mate!

297
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,067
Drop the gun and step away.

298
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:57,386
I'm warnin' you!

299
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:59,621
Put it down, I said-

300
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:06,030
Jesus Minge! You killed him!
You shot him dead!

301
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:07,967
No turnin' back now, Gary.

302
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:10,824
Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh.

303
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:12,085
Oh keep your head, Gary.

00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:15,199
I can't, uh...
I'm goinna puke!

305
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,795
Ah, Gary, that smells awful!
Now I'm gonna throw up!

306
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,242
Try to leave and I'll shoot you too!

307
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,737
You hostages aren't goin' anywhere
till we get what we want!

308
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:32,641
Oh my God, what are we goinna do?

309
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:34,952
You got us into this, towel.
Think of somethin'!

310
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:37,507
All right, I'm gonna get a little high.

311
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:41,577
No! No I'm not gonna get high!

312
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:45,792
Every time I get high, I come up with
ideas that get me in more trouble.

313
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,223
I'm not gettin' high this time!

314
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:56,815
I'm standing in the business
district of central Chicago

315
00:17:56,816 --> 00:18:01,732
where Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer
and taken several people hostage.

316
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:06,613
It is yet unconfirmed but believed that Oprah's
asshole may be an accomplice in this as well.

317
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:11,141
Got the walkie-talkie you asked for.

318
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,285
Put it underneath me.

319
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,102
Slowly, mate, slowly!

320
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:18,190
Now back off.

321
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:21,982
All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.

322
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:25,629
This is Oprah's minge!
- Hello, I'm Lieutenant Nelson.

323
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,822
What are your demands?

324
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:30,989
I want a chopper and a jet waiting at
the airport to take us to France!

325
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:33,142
Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.

326
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:36,249
All right, how about fresh
underwear for one hostage.

327
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,112
I'm not playing games with you, mate!

328
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:40,278
Gary's drownin' in his own sick!

329
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:42,754
All right, we'll work on it.
Don't do anything foolish.

330
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:46,084
We don't have any time, this is the most
unstable vagina I've ever talked to.

331
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:47,639
O'Reilly, you got a shot?

332
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:48,709
I got it.

333
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:53,000
Not with those hostages so close!
It's too risky!

334
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:56,904
Oh just put down the gun, Mingie.
Maybe they'll go easy on us.

335
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:58,348
Don't be stupid, Gary.

336
00:18:58,445 --> 00:19:02,431
I've got a policeman.
They'll fry me, lock you up for life.

337
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:05,570
Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.

338
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:07,710
We're gonna get out of here, mate.
Just leave it to me.

339
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,127
Oprah's vagina,
this is your last warning!

340
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:11,474
Put down the gun!

341
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:14,558
If that chopper isn't here
in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!

342
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,336
Hey wait a minute.

343
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:32,187
I mean it! Hostages are gonna
start dyin' if you don't listen!

344
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:36,006
Hostages are clear!

345
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,815
All right, that's it.
Take it out!

346
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:43,065
What the? Haha! You missed me,
you stewpid buggers!

347
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:45,402
You see that Gary?
They can't even aim!

348
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:49,964
Min... Mingie.
- Gary, what's, what's wrong?

349
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,484
They got me, Mingie.

350
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,501
No... Oh no!

351
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,140
Aye. They got me bad.
Oh, the blood.

352
00:19:58,223 --> 00:19:59,543
Try to hang on, Gary!

353
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,778
It's gettin' dark, Minge.

354
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:04,436
Oh Gary!
What have I gotten ya into?

355
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:07,227
I've seen muh life flash before me eyes.

356
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:09,403
Mingie!

357
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:10,417
I'm 'ere, Gary!

358
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:12,613
Where... where are we, Mingie?

359
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,699
Are we in Paris?

360
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:18,046
Yeah.
Yeah, we're in Paris, mate.

361
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:21,011
Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?

362
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,933
Ih, it's beautiful.
We've finally made it!

363
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,808
Tell me what you see, Mingie.

364
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:29,116
Well, there's the...
Eiffel Tower right in front of us.

365
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,681
The Louvre, right over there behind ya.

366
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,905
And fresh baguettes all around.

367
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:37,100
Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie.

368
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:41,187
At least I got to see Paris before I-

369
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:46,471
Gary?
Gary, say somethin'.

370
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:50,443
You killed him, you bastards!

371
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:52,414
He didn't even want any part in this!

372
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:54,749
This is all your fault, you stupid cow!

373
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:58,009
You never gave your ol' Gary
the time of day and now he's gone!

374
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:00,318
Life ain't worth livin' any more!

375
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,736
What's the use?!

376
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,197
I'm comin' to see you, Gary!
I'm comin' to see ya!

377
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:06,888
No!
Don't!

378
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,583
Oprah's going to be okay.

379
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:21,977
Wish I could say the same
for her vagina and asshole.

380
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,351
That's a great idea you had
to sneak the hostages inside the bank.

381
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:26,596
Yeah, it sure was.

382
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,019
We're sorry we tried to burn you
and murder you before.

383
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:30,447
Aw, that's okay.

384
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:32,615
This whole thing was my fault.

385
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:37,476
I learned that I shouldn't get
high to come up with ideas.

386
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:42,123
I should come up with ideas
and then get high, to reward myself.

387
00:21:42,707 --> 00:21:44,248
You said it.
