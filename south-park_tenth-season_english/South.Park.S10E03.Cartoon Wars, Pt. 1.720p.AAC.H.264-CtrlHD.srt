1
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,300
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid.

2
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,100
He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.

3
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Good night my little angel.

4
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,600
- Stan !
- What ?! What ?!

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Get up ! Get your shoes on ! Gotta get out of here ! MOOVE !

6
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,500
Take this, we've goota bring all the water we can !

7
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Shelly go get my gun !

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
What's going on, dad ?

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,202
Just get the gun !!!

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,203
All right, come on !

11
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,700
Kyle, what the hell is going on this time ?

12
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,000
I have no idea.

13
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,400
Take cover in the community center again.

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,100
All right, everyone get in, and get a seal on that door !

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,200
Oh my God, Steven, we've let Butters !

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,800
We can't go back out there Linda, it's too late for him.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,600
Dad ? Dad what the hell is going on ?

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,200
A cartoon ! A cartoon is about to air on American television with...

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
with the Muslim prophet Muhammed as a character.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
So ?

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,900
So ? Stanley, Muhammad is sacred to the Muslim people.

22
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Nobody shows an image of Muhammad anymore.

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,300
Which cartoon is it ?

25
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,800
What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Muhammad as a character ?

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
Who do you think ?

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,900
The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor !

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,700
<i>Family Guy !</i>

29
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
<i>How could Family Guy do that ?</i>

30
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,900
<i>Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims ?</i>

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult.</i>

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They only care about their precious money !

33
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,300
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon ?

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,100
We've got the TV working.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Muhammad

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,300
<i>is set to air tonight on Family Guy.</i>

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Oh Randy hold me !

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,800
The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,700
All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags

40
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,500
<i>and Family Guy posters.</i>

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement :

42
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,600
So what happens now ?

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
We stay here through the night,

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,500
wait it out to see if they do anything.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,700
If we're still alive in the morning,

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
then we'll know we're not dead !

47
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,600
It's okay !

48
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
We're alive ? We're alive !

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Everyone, everyone listen !

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,600
Fox network censored the image
of Muhammad at the last minute !

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
Oh thank God !

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Well it looks like we dodged a bullet.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,800
They censored the image
of Muhammad ? How ?

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I tivo every episode, we can go
to my house and see what they did.

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,600
Okay you guys, check it out !

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>You tivo every episode of Family Guy ?</i>

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Dude, it's a good show !

58
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,100
<i>Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.</i>

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,800
Peter, I can't believe you invited your
old highschool sweetheart over for dinner !

60
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,800
You think that's bad ?

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Remember when I auditioned to be
David Hasselhoff's car ?

62
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,800
- Hey there, Knight Rider !
- After those bad guys, Kitt !

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,100
Yeah but dad, why would you invite
an ex-girlfriend to dinner ?

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,000
Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Nervous ?

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,700
Like when I had to sell pancakes
to this school soccer captain ?

67
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
Pancakes for you, Captain !

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,500
I'll be the captain, and you'll be Tennille.

69
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,100
<i>Love will keep us together</i>

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,400
But, Peter, I don't wanna cook
dinner for your ex-girlfriend !

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Well, maybe we can just have tea.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,300
You mean like the time you had tea with Muhammed,

73
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,900
the prophet of the Muslim faith ?

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,500
Come on, Muhammed,
let's get some tea !

75
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,800
Try my Mister T... tea.

76
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,700
Boy, was that ever weird.

77
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Anyway, I can't believe I invited
my old sweetheart to dinner, huh !

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
That's it ? That's all they did ?

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Oh man, that's not cool !

80
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,600
- Seriously, that is not cool.
- Why, what's the big deal ?

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
What's the big deal ?

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
You guys, they've just made fun of
the religion of an entire group of people.

83
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,800
What, you guys think that's okay ?

84
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,500
Do you care at all about people's feelings ?

85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,200
Since when do you care about being
sensitive to people's religion, Cartman ?

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time !

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's different.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm just a little boy !

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,400
That's a cartoon.

90
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,700
Millions of people watch it !

91
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,100
How would you feel, Kyle,
if there's a cartoon on television

92
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
that make fun of Jews all the time, huh ?

93
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm telling you guys, it's wrong.

94
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
It's wrong !

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,000
It's wroooong !

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,400
Kyle ! Kyle what are you watching ?

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,100
Hey Brian, this is like the time
I got a job as a carrot cake.

98
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,700
<i>It's Family Guy !
Quick Gerald, do something.</i>

99
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,800
Dad, dad ! Jesus Christ !

100
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,200
It's okay, it's dead.

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,200
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show !

102
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,600
Mom, it was nothing !

103
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,700
Muhammad just stood there and drank some tea.

104
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,000
You boys don't understand anything.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,700
It's obvious that you all need Muslim sensitivity training.

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,500
Welcome to Muslim sensitivity training.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,300
It is important for us to understand
why the Muslims feel the way they do.

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
And why we can never show an image of Muhammed.

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,100
No, Muslims can't show an image of Muhammad.

110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,000
Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,200
Yeah Kyle, maybe you think this is funny

112
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
but the rest of us don't.

113
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Let's all look at why Muslims are upset.

114
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,300
First of all, in the Muslim religion,
you're not allowed to have what ?

115
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,200
Sex ! Good !

116
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world.

117
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Now this would be fine except that in
the Muslim religion you also can't... ?

118
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Anybody ?

119
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,100
Jack off !

120
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Okay jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,900
And what do we know about
the places Muslims live ?

122
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,400
They live in...

123
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Good, sand !

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,300
Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim,

125
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,200
it's friday night but you can't have sex
and you can't jack off.

126
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,900
There's sand in your eyes, and probably in the crack of your ass

127
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,500
and then some cartoon comes along
from a country where people are getting laid

128
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,900
and mocks your prophet !

129
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,800
Well, you know what ?
I'd be pretty pissed off too !

130
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Mrs Garrison, that is ignorant and racist !

131
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
<i>Muslims are mad because of Family Guy,
not because they can't jack off !</i>

132
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,300
Right Wendy ?

133
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,600
Yeah !

134
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,800
Attention students, proceed to the school gymnasium immediately

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
for an emergency announcement.

136
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
The hell's going on now ?

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,300
Shh, quiet students, quiet !

138
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,500
<i>Once again, we have just learn that the Family Guy episode</i>

139
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,200
featuring Muhammed,
was only part one of a two-parter !

140
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,000
And part two is going to air next week,
with Muhammed uncensored !

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,200
What ?

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,300
- Why would they...
- Fox studios claim that

143
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,003
<i>the Family Guy writing staff</i>

144
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:16,007
has demanded the Muhammed
character be seen in full-view.

145
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
The head of Fox had this to say.

146
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,500
<i>Family Guy is our biggest show.</i>

147
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,900
If they insist we don't
censor their work, then we can't.

148
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,200
<i>Family Guy !</i>

149
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,500
I damn you to hell !

150
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,200
Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East.

151
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,900
This time even more massive.

152
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,900
And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Retaliation !

154
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Oh my God ! M'kay.

155
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,100
<i>Goddamned Family Guy !</i>

156
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,200
Now they're just provoking people,
it's like they want a holy war !

157
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,900
Does this mean
we don't have school all week ?

158
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,400
You guys, this is serious.
We have to do something !

159
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,200
<i>- Like what ?
- We have to go to Fox network in L.A.</i>

160
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
We have to go and...

161
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
try to get that episode pulled.

162
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
You guys with me ?

163
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Due we can't go anywhere,
they've shutdown the airports and the buses.

164
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,500
Then we'll ride our big wheels !

165
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,300
- To Los Angeles ?
- If that's what it takes, yes !

166
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,700
We have to talk to the network.

167
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,800
<i>The Family Guy writers
aren't gonna back down !</i>

168
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,500
Well good for them !
They shouldn't.

169
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,400
The writers are standing up and saying
they aren't going to be intimidated.

170
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,100
Intimidated ? Is that what you think
this is about Kyle ?

171
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you ?

172
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't trust for one second that you're sudden
concern for the Muslim people is real !

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,600
All right, fine Kyle. Forget
the Muslim faith for a minute.

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
People can get hurt.

175
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
<i>If ten people die because Family Guy
just had to have their little joke</i>

176
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,900
Will you still think it's funny ?

177
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,100
What if a hundred people die ?

178
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,600
Will it be funny then Kyle ?

179
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm going to Los Angeles.

180
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,100
And I'm gonna do whatever I can

181
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,300
to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hands.

182
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,400
Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people !

183
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,500
Somebody has to speak for what's right !

184
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,400
Kyle ! Kyle wake up, we have to go !

185
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
The terrorists are attacking !

186
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,500
Dad, are you sure this time ?

187
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,900
This isn't a joke Kyle.

188
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,200
Bombs have already gone off in six cities !

189
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,900
No !

190
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,500
Wait a minute ! Where's Ike ?!

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,300
He was just here ! Ike !

192
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Ike !

193
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,100
Ike ? Iiike ! Ike !

194
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,400
Ice cream. I want chocolate.

195
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
Ike ! This way !

196
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,900
Kyyyle !

197
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,400
Nooooo

198
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Come to try and stop me ?! It isn't gonna work.

199
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,400
I didn't come to stop you.

200
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,000
I... I think you're right, Cartman.

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,700
<i>I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.</i>

202
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,500
Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.

203
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,100
Especially one who doesn't trust me.

204
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,300
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but...

205
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,300
I think it's pretty amazing.

206
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,700
And I think it's real.

207
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,000
You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.

208
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,800
Yeah. I do understand, Kyle.

209
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
I've been doing the wrong things for a long time.

210
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Doing things for my own selfish reasons.

211
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
I just wanna do something right, you know ?

212
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Just this one time.

213
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,900
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help.

214
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,200
We can try and get the episode pulled together.

215
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
You know we might not even make it into the studio.

216
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
I know.

217
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
But just like you, I feel like I have to try.

218
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
People can really get hurt,

219
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,300
and a joke just isn't worth that.

220
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,400
So what made you change your mind ?

221
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,300
I got some sound advice... from an old friend.

222
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,700
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.

223
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Yeah !

224
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,700
- Are you set ?
- I'm set ! Let's do this !

225
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,200
All right, let's roll !

226
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,300
People ! People, quiet, please !

227
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,900
We must not panic !

228
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,500
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor ?!

229
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days !</i>

230
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University

231
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,400
has come up with a solution.

232
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Thank you, Mayor.

233
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,000
Now look, everyone.

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,700
Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us

235
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,500
<i>for what Family Guy is going to do...</i>

236
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,200
because they've wrongly grouped us together.

237
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know...

238
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,500
that we had no part in the Muhammad episode.

239
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,400
That even though the episode aired,

240
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,400
we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it,

241
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,200
and we didn't talk about it.

242
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,300
So how do we do that ?

243
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,600
We bury our heads. In sand.

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,200
We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks,

245
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,000
fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue.

246
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,500
By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels,

247
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,400
we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes,

248
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,800
and then have the person to our left bury them.

249
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,100
If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand

250
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,600
before the Muhammad episode airs,

251
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,600
we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all.

252
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,500
No, no, wait a minute, that's ridiculous.

253
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,200
Look, what we need to do is just the opposite.

254
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,000
Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see ?

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Muhammad,

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,400
and show the terrorists and the extremists

257
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
that we are all united in the belief that every person

258
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,300
has a right to say what they want !

259
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Look, people, it's...

260
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,400
it's been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately.

261
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,300
For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it.

262
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,200
But those times are going to come !

263
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,300
And one of those times is right now.

264
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,200
And if we... aren't willing to risk what we have,

265
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,300
then we just believe in free speech,

266
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,700
but we don't defend it.

267
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,300
I like the sand idea.

268
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,100
Yeah, me too.

269
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler.

270
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,700
- Let's do the sand !
- Yeah, yeah !

271
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,500
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand !

272
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,000
Let's move, people !

273
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
We've got six days to make it to Los Angeles.

274
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,900
If we keep our stops to a minimum,

275
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,200
we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.

276
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,600
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now,

277
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,900
<i>Family Guy will be off the air forever.</i>

278
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,300
Off the air ? But...

279
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,500
we're just going to try to get the Muhammad episode pulled.

280
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,400
It's simple television economics, Kyle.

281
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled.

282
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims,

283
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,100
then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled.

284
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,700
And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled.

285
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,100
<i>And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more !</i>

286
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,400
It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

287
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
Whoa whoa wait a minute !

288
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,800
This isn't what I signed up for !

289
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,100
<i>I like Family Guy.</i>

290
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Why do we have to get it off the air forever ?

291
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,300
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and... and that's wrong.

292
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,400
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air.

293
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,400
<i>You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.</i>

294
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,100
<i>Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy !</i>

295
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,200
You hear me Kyle ??!!

296
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
<i>Compare me to Family Guy again,</i>

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,700
and so help me I will kill you where you stand !

298
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,100
You unbelievable son of a bitch.

299
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
You never cared about the Muslim religion

300
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,300
or the safety of people in America.

301
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,800
<i>You just want Family Guy off the air !</i>

302
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,300
Do you have any idea what it's like ?!

303
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,700
<i>Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right ?"</i>

304
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,200
<i>"Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."</i>

305
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,700
<i>I am NOTHING like Family Guy !</i>

306
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,200
When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story !

307
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,100
Deep, situational and emotional jokes

308
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
based on what is relevant and has a POINT !

309
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Not just one random interchangeable joke after another !!

310
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,800
What are you talking about ?!

311
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND !

312
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side.

313
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,700
You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.

314
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,700
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now.

315
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,400
No biggie.

316
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,900
I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled !

317
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,600
No ! I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend...

318
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,300
to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air !

319
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,800
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw ?

320
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What ?

321
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,900
CARTMAN !

322
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,200
Kyle, stop it !

323
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Holy Crap !

324
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,300
Stay on 'em !

325
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,500
Jesus and Mary !

326
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,700
If you have children,

327
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,800
be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own.

328
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,400
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.

329
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,900
It's the best way, Stanley.
Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up ?

330
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,700
Yeah.

331
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,500
All right, make sure your snorkel is working.

332
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,900
All right, now get your head in the hole.

333
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,200
Dad, this is stupid.

334
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,800
Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity ! Do it !

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,900
All right Sharon, now do me.

336
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,000
Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'.

337
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,500
If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left,

338
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
then who's gonna bury the last person's head ?

339
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,600
Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and...

340
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,900
not have his head in the sand.

341
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,900
- I'll do it.
- Dylan, no !

342
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
You realize by not burying your head in sand,

343
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
<i>you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience.</i>

344
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes, I know.

345
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,700
Dylan, please, you can't !

346
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Somebody has to do it, Sarah.

347
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,100
You run along now and you get your head in the sand.

348
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,400
I'll be all right.

349
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
You have to understand... I'm all she has.

350
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,600
Who are those people ?

351
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No !

352
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Hahahaha ! So long, Kyle !

353
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,100
You son of a bitch ! I won't let you win ! You hear me ?!

354
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,000
Suck my balls, Kyle !

355
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,100
Are you the network president ?

356
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,400
Yes, Mr. President.

357
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,800
<i>We need to discuss this Family Guy episode, Mr. President.</i>

358
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Mr. President, my hands are tied.

359
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,700
<i>The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Muhammad.</i>

360
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,700
But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security.

361
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,600
They must be reasoned with.

362
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,200
Mr. President,

363
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,100
<i>there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know.</i>

364
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,600
The race continues.

365
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,100
<i>Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio</i>

366
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,600
<i>and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff.</i>

367
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
This... explains everything.

368
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,900
As an entire nation buries its head in sand...

369
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,600
The idea has swept the nation !

370
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
But where will we find enough sand for everyone ?

371
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Kyle, quit it ! Quit it, Kyle !

372
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,000
Or will Comedy Central puss out ?

373
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,500
<i>Tune in to see Part 2 of Family Guy,</i>

374
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,300
next week, on South Park !
