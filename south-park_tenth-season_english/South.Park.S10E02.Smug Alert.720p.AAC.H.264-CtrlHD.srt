1
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:41,539
Hey there, Richard!

2
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:43,935
Oh, hey Gerald.
New car?

3
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,752
Yeah. It's a hybrid.

4
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,673
I just... I just couldn't sit back and be a
part of destroying the earth anymore.

5
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:53,047
Well... Good for you.

6
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,695
Oho... Thaanks.

7
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:01,350
Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty
Gerald Broflovski.

8
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:06,672
Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid
he thinks he's better than everyone else.

9
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:14,947
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like
yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone.

10
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:18,883
I drive a hybrid,
it's much better for the environment.

11
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:20,036
Thaaanks.

12
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:24,854
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you
got this car is drive around and show it off!

13
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:28,251
Hey, is that a hybrid?

14
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:30,445
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.

15
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:34,268
Yeah, I like to be a part of the soluuution
and not part of the probluuhm.

16
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,826
Well, anyway, good for you!

17
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,221
Thaaanks.

18
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:41,502
Dad, I think Ike is starving to death.

19
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:44,348
Hold on, boys.
We still have to go to the hardware store

20
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:47,354
and hand out awareness citations
to SUV cars in the parking lot.

21
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:49,273
What?!

22
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,659
Okay, there's another one.

23
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,006
Aw, man! Look at that!

24
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,923
Can you believe this?!

25
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,826
An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!

26
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:05,006
"Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler."

27
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,766
Dad, can we go home, please?

28
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,175
Look, there's a Jeep over there!
Go write them a ticket, Kyle!

29
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:11,092
But Dad, I want-
- Now, Kyle!

30
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,979
Oh hey Kyle.
- Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?

31
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:18,802
Helping my Dad pick out some cool
new power tools. What are you doing?

32
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,681
Helping my Dad give people fake tickets.

33
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:23,674
What's this?

34
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,938
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.

35
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:26,855
A ticket?

36
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,396
"Failure to care about the environment."

37
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,649
Oh Goddamnit, did you do this, Gerald?!

38
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:35,153
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make
people more aware you know, it's a-

39
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:38,405
You got some nerve, you know that?!
Where do you come off ticketing people?!

40
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,723
Well, Randy, calm down.
It's not a real ticket.

41
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:42,487
I know it's not a real ticket!!

42
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:45,605
Broflovski, did you put
this crap on my windshield?!

43
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:48,705
Jimbo, your truck probably gets
less than ten miles to the gallon.

44
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,705
Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!

45
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:52,025
Dad, let's just go!

46
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,904
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of
South Park aware of a very serious problem.

47
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:59,442
The problem, Gerald,
is that ever since you got a hybrid car,

48
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:02,859
you've gotten so smug that
you love the smell of your own farts!

49
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:07,658
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was
"high and mighty" to care about the earth!

50
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:11,870
And that too! Stop talking with your
eyes closed! That's what smug people do!

51
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,647
Well, I really don't see how
that has anything to do with the-

52
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,092
There, like that! Stop that!

53
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:19,419
Who the hell put this faggy
fake ticket on my truck!

54
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:20,905
All right, that does it!

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,363
Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging
around with these ignorant idiots!

56
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:31,834
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best
we just do it right away.

57
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:33,038
Dad.

58
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:38,482
Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well,
we feel that your new car is changing you.

59
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,259
Yes, it certainly is.

60
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:43,554
We're thinking that a lot of people
in town starting tooo...

61
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:45,609
Take offense.

62
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,831
...are starting to take
offense at your actions.

63
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:51,012
We feel like you're starting to becuhhhm...

64
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,928
Alienated.

65
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:56,144
...star-starting to become alienated
from some of your friends.

66
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,464
Well, I totally agree, Kyle.

67
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:00,977
You do?
- Yes.

68
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:04,095
A lot of people in town just
aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.

69
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,776
Right!
Okay, good.

70
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:08,817
And that's why, I've talked it over
with your mother, and

71
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:10,748
...we've decided to move!

72
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,237
What?!

73
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,264
We need to be where everyone is motivated
and progressive like us!

74
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:22,001
Start getting your things packed, boys!
The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco!

75
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:25,850
Yeah?

76
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:31,894
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over.
Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.

77
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,646
Going away party?
What do you mean?

78
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,165
Well don't you know?
Kyle's movin' away.

79
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:38,998
Moving away?
Kyle can't move away!

80
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,318
Well he is.
- Where's the going-away party?

81
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:42,596
At Cartman's house.

82
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:47,342
Hey everybody!
There's more pop in the refrigerator.

83
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:50,121
Let's make this the best going-away party ever!

84
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:52,832
Hey Eric, where is Kyle?

85
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:54,083
Who?

86
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,108
Kyle, the person leaving.

87
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,128
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?

88
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,922
Dude, a going-away party is suppose
to be for the person who is going away!

89
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:03,139
Kyle? Kyle!

90
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:05,014
Kyle's not here.
Cartman didn't invite him.

91
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:05,764
What?!

92
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:10,216
You guys, this is our party. That no-good
back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving!

93
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:13,175
Come on, everyone! Let's sing!
Nanana na!

94
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:16,162
Nanana  na!
Hey hey hey!

95
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,592
Goodbye Kyle!

96
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:20,442
Kyle! Dude what is going on?!

97
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,397
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.

98
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,096
Mr. Broflovski, please.
Kyle's my best friend.

99
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:30,186
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a
small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.

100
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,508
Well...  Maybe they'll change.

101
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:33,973
I wouldn't count on it.

102
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,958
Come on, boys, get in the car!

103
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,251
No!

104
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:42,442
Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.
Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars.

105
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:46,734
Until that day, we're just gonna
have to be with our own kind.

106
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:52,549
I will. I will get everyone to
drive hybrid cars! I swear it!

107
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,472
Well? What do you think, huh?

108
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,666
Oh Gerald, it's beau-tiful.

109
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,208
Yeah. Now this, is a house.

110
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,611
Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.

111
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,972
Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.

112
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,596
Welcome to San Francisco.
I'm Peter Thompson.

113
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:26,694
This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis
and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis.

114
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:28,069
So how do you like the neighborhood?

115
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:31,096
Oh it's gorgeous.
These old houses are so neat.

116
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,916
Yes, well, unlike most cities

117
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:37,306
in San Francisco we try to keep all the
historic houses instead of knocking them down.

118
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:38,416
You in here, Peter?

119
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,667
Oh hay, Paul.
Come on in and meet the Broflovskis.

120
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:43,097
Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue.

121
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:45,430
This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan

122
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:48,433
and our daughter,
Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan.

123
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,405
Hello.

124
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:52,100
We noticed your hybrid out front,
that's a V series, right?

125
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,266
Yeah. That's right.

126
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:56,085
Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna
have to get you into the BT series.

127
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:57,600
Its emissions are actually cleaner.

128
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:00,462
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?

129
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,893
Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive
and ahead of the curve here in San Franciso.

130
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,073
Ahhhm.

131
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:10,654
Anyway, I'm sure you'll
find it much better here.

132
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:14,995
Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much
more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest.

133
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:18,606
Ahhh, ahh.

134
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:22,898
We're just a little bit more protective of
our environment here in San Francisco.

135
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,649
Yeah. We sure are.

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,692
<i>Come on, people. Come on, people now.</i>

137
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,373
Dude, what are you doing?

138
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,577
I'm writing a song about
the importance of hybrid cars

139
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:36,252
so maybe people will change their ways.

140
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:38,446
That's gay, heh.

141
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,071
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back.
I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!

142
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:45,724
Why do you want Kyle back?
Don't you see how awesome it is without him?

143
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,237
You know, Cartman,
you may be stoked now

144
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:50,612
but I bet you're gonna find that
without Kyle around to rip on

145
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:52,654
your life is empty, and hollow.

146
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,985
Psh! Whatever dude.
I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters.

147
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,805
Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew!

148
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,013
Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew.

149
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:07,683
<i>Come on, people. Come on, people now.</i>

150
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:14,114
All right, all you dreamers and creamers
out there out there in South Park

151
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:18,678
I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that
really made me think about my impact on the earth.

152
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:23,205
This is Stan Marsh with "Hey, People,
You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already"

153
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,538
<i>Come on now, people now people now</i>

154
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,608
<i>People now, come on now, people now</i>

155
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,622
<i>Got to drive hybrids, people now</i>

156
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,678
<i>People now, people now, people now</i>

157
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,713
<i>Hybrids are for people now, people now</i>

158
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,716
<i>Group of people driving people now</i>

159
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,349
<i>Get a hybrid, be good people now.</i>

160
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:39,543
He's right.

161
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,816
<i>We have all got to be people now</i>

162
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:43,881
<i>People-driving-hybrid people now</i>

163
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,904
<i>People now, people now, hybrid now</i>

164
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:47,931
<i>Hybrid-people-driving people now.</i>

165
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:49,931
<i>Come on, people, let's be people now</i>

166
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,056
<i>Hybrid-people-driving people now</i>

167
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:54,959
<i>Come on, everybody be people now.</i>

168
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:58,082
Hey Jimbo, you got a hybrid too?

169
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:01,731
Yeah, I just wanted to try
to set an example, you know?

170
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:05,495
Yeah, I guess it's up to us to show
everyone the way. Good for you!

171
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,454
Thaaanks.

172
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:10,708
Can you believe some people
still don't drive hybrids?

173
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:16,805
I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello?
This is simple stuff here. Gawl"

174
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:20,991
Well from now on, I'm only going to
associate with other hybride-car drivers.

175
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,853
Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?

176
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:25,794
Good for you!

177
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:27,398
Thaaanks!

178
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:29,938
At least we're smart enough to know better!

179
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,218
Thaaanks!

180
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:36,300
<i>Come on, everybody be people now.</i>

181
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:39,675
And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh

182
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:45,163
for making South Park the city with the highest
percentage of hybrid owners in the country!

183
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:50,372
If only the rest of the country
was as insightful as we are.

184
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,696
Ah, thanks.

185
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:54,973
I was really just trying to make it
so my friend can move back here so...

186
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:57,501
if you don't mind,
I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now.

187
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,293
Great speech!

188
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:05,120
Yeah, well, you know my son is just
a little bit more clever than some.

189
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:08,772
Hello  there, I'm Ranger McFriendly.

190
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:12,355
I'm the person who watches over
the delicate ecosystem of South Park.

191
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,546
You must be the little boy who wrote that song.

192
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:15,310
Yeah.

193
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:19,518
You son of a bitch!
Do you have any idea what you've done?!

194
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:20,171
What?!

195
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,750
Come  with me!

196
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,028
There! Look!

197
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:29,061
Smog? There's never been
smog over South Park before.

198
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,269
Don't you get it?!

199
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,074
When people drive hybrid cars

200
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:36,927
they get so full of themselves they spew
tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air!

201
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:40,510
That isn't smog, it's smug!

202
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,205
Smug?

203
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:45,198
Hybrid cars make better for emission levels

204
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:48,378
but people who drive hybrid cars
are the leading cause of smug.

205
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:51,045
You can have smug in the atmosphere
and you know what that leads to?

206
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:52,198
Global laming!

207
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:57,573
Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is
now the secong smuggiest city in America!

208
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,634
<i>This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!</i>

209
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:06,759
It looks like we have
a smug alert here in South Park.

210
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:09,431
Our own Keenan Williams has the details.
Keenan?

211
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,472
Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in
effect at least tomorrow morning.

212
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:16,065
All those hybrid cars on the
road have caused heavy smug

213
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:19,107
to develop over most of Park
and Jefferson Counties.

214
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,301
On the national map

215
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:24,447
we can see smug over Denver
and developing smug in Los Angeles.

216
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:28,739
However, San Francisco is once again
the smuggiest city in the country.

217
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:35,580
<i>A smuggy day in San Francisco town.</i>

218
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:41,537
Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian, yet?

219
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,592
No! Hello, how are you?

220
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:45,842
Really good, really good.

221
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:49,800
Hey there. Alan, right?

222
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:51,314
Actually, it's Alain.

223
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:53,847
Right right, w-would,
would you like red or white wine?

224
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,749
Can I just get an empty glass?

225
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,138
Oh. Sure.

226
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,685
Can you believe all these imbecils in Texas?

227
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,657
They just put another prisoner to death.

228
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:08,610
So...

229
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,860
what do you do for fun?

230
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:13,291
We drink and take drugs.

231
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,138
You want some acid?

232
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:17,127
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.

233
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,537
You will. There's a reason most
San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.

234
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:22,571
It's the only thing that allows
us to deal with our parents

235
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:25,280
all walking around loving the smell
of their own farts all the time.

236
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,321
Everthing okay in here, Kyle?

237
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:28,596
Yeah, fine, Dad.

238
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,818
So much better here with
the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?

239
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,664
Mmmm.

240
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,484
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.

241
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,144
I want three.

242
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,825
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing
for Broflovski in San Francisco!

243
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:48,917
They just moved there!

244
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:53,364
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs
can't even play video football!

245
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,292
Yeah. You're right.

246
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,727
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.

247
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,338
Well I'm sorry. Well it shows that
I'm not Jewish, and now th-

248
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:04,876
No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!

249
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,088
Marsh!

250
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,837
Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.

251
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,463
Who?

252
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,185
You'd better come with me to the news station!
Our situation just got a lot worse!

253
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:17,702
noticed it on the computer this morning.
Look here.

254
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:23,019
This is the smug over South Park.
It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.

255
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,170
The  smug?

256
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:27,101
The smug is getting so massive
that it's moving west...

257
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:30,569
and fusing with the San Francisco smug...
Here.

258
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,708
These two smug clouds are
combining, fueling each other.

259
00:13:33,738 --> 00:13:35,153
Now take a look at this.

260
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,153
What is that?

261
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,010
It's the smug from George Clooney's
acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.

262
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,743
George Clooney's acceptance speech?

263
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,673
Did you hear it?

264
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:46,090
He talked about how people in Hollywood
are ahead of the curve on social mattes.

265
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,221
He even took credit for
the Civil Rights movement -Look!

266
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:49,291
The point is...

267
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:53,902
the smug from his acceptance speech has
been slowly drifting north since he gave it...

268
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:56,082
and is headed straight for the supercell.

269
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:59,909
The South Park and San Francisco
smug is already at critical mass.

270
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:03,020
If it gets hit by George Clooney's
acceptance speech

271
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,798
it will be a disaster of epic proportions.

272
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,603
The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.

273
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,577
We've got to tell the townspeople!

274
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:14,105
South Park still has a chance
to make it through the storm!

275
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,520
What about San Francisco?

276
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:21,703
Kid, thanks to your gay little song,
there's not gonna be a San Francisco.

277
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,326
Soo, that's it people.

278
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:29,729
When the smug from George Clooney's speech
hits the San Francisco and South Park smug

279
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:32,884
we're gonna witness a storm the
likes of which we've never seen.

280
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:37,162
Are you trying to tell us the smug from
our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?

281
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:40,551
If the smug clouds remain
the way they are, yes.

282
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,928
This is all Stan's fault!

283
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:48,650
He wrote that gay little song and
got us to drive those damned hybrids!

284
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,196
Yeah. Good going, stupid!

285
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:57,974
Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's
fault, there is still something we can do.

286
00:14:58,057 --> 00:15:01,085
If we all work together to reduce smugness

287
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:04,617
we might be able to lessen the effects of
the storm, at least here in our own town.

288
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:08,144
Then that's it.
There's only one way to reduce smugness.

289
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,532
We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town!

290
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:15,226
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's!

291
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,501
Hey, where do you think you're going?!

292
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,348
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle
to get out of San Francisco.

293
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,572
Oh no you're not!

294
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:26,002
Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids,
you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!

295
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:29,183
How long do we have until
the smug clouds collide?

296
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,144
Not long.

297
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:34,603
The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards
Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.

298
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:45,770
The hell is that?

299
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:02,368
<i>"Oscar winner, George Clooney, sexiest man alive"</i>

300
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:09,313
Wow, Eric.
You sure are a great guy for doing this.

301
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:10,469
I don't have a choice.

302
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,246
Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn
Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.

303
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,204
But... how come we can't
just take the bus on into the city?

304
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:18,944
You don't know San Francisco, Butters.

305
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,221
It was the breeding ground for
the hippie movement in the 60s.

306
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:24,787
Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists
and diehard modern hippies young and old.

307
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,164
I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco.

308
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:30,314
God help me.

309
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:37,755
All right, Butters,
I'll be tethered to you through this cord.

310
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:40,422
It's my only lifeline,
so make sure it stays taut.

311
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,758
If you stop hearing my voice,
for the love of Christ

312
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,341
start reeling me in with all your strength.

313
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:47,438
I will. You're really great for
going to warn Kyle, Eric.

314
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:49,091
I'm not doin' it for Kyle.

315
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,512
I can't believe I'm actually going
to walk through San Francisco.

316
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:54,623
Well, here it goes.

317
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,549
All right. All right,
now get it into the masher! Hurry up!

318
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,902
Can't somebody else opeate this?
I can't really reach.

319
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:14,221
Well then you shouldn't have written
that gay little song, shouldn't you have?!

320
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,009
Keenan, we've gotten rid of half
the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!

321
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:26,411
They're dropping, slowly,
but... but we're running out of time!

322
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:37,917
Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more
of a European city, like Paris or Milan.

323
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,596
Butters, are you there?!
- I'm here, Eric.

324
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:44,368
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a
quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?

325
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,882
You must be nearing Union Square.
Did you see a fountain to your left?

326
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:51,701
Yes. It's just beyond yet
another wine and cheese store.

327
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:55,177
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right.
You've got to start heading west.

328
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:57,371
Turning right at O two four niner.

329
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,108
That's  it. That's that the last one.

330
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,038
Keenan?
Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!

331
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,659
Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech
is about to hit the other smug system!

332
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:16,534
Get everyone inside!

333
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,331
God help us.

334
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:39,193
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here!
2419 Castillo?!

335
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:43,832
That's it! Eric, hurry!
Somethin's goin' on out here!

336
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:50,234
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski,
there a smug storm! We have to go!

337
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,109
Being smug is a good thing.

338
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,653
Oh my Christ!

339
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:59,750
Kyle? Kyle!

340
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:04,429
The acid.
Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.

341
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,387
I'm totally tripping balls.

342
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,789
I'm totally tripping balls.

343
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,775
We have to get out of here!
Now!

344
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:16,388
Kyle!

345
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:19,638
Kyle!

346
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:31,690
<i>And now, the worst appears to be over.</i>

347
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:35,444
<i>Last night's smug storm...
has left thousands homeless.</i>

348
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:40,378
<i>All across the Midwest,
people are picking up the pieces.</i>

349
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,868
<i>Cities like Denver and South Lake
are heavily damaged</i>

350
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,034
<i>but still all right.</i>

351
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:48,652
<i>However, San Francisco, I'm afraid...</i>

352
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:52,110
<i>has disappeared completely up its own asshole.</i>

353
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:54,596
No.

354
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,570
I'm sorry, Stan.

355
00:19:57,054 --> 00:20:00,161
I'm sorry your gay little
song killed your friend.

356
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:04,405
Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it!

357
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:05,585
You've gotta come see.

358
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,238
What?
- It's a miracle!

359
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:12,378
Kyle!

360
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:14,705
Hey Stan.
- Dude, what happened?

361
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:17,047
We don't know. We were all passed out and...

362
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:20,414
next thing we know we just
woke up on a bus heading here.

363
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:23,456
It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay?

364
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:27,190
Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.

365
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:30,953
So I guess there's nothing
left to do now but... rebuild.

366
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:34,050
Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.

367
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:37,553
And let's make sure nobody
gets a stupid hybrid, right?

368
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,643
No! Hybrid cars are a good thing!

369
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:45,896
But hybrid cars are the
leading cause of smug, m'kay?

370
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:49,096
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.

371
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:56,066
Look, hybrid cars are important.
They may even save our planet one day.

372
00:20:56,066 --> 00:21:00,400
What you all need to do is just learn
to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.

373
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,124
You mean...

374
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:07,524
drive in hybrids... but not act like we're
better than everyone else because of it.

375
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:08,399
Yeah!

376
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,830
I'm...
I'm not ready...

377
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,106
I don't think I can do it either.

378
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:16,091
It's simply asking too much.

379
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:21,739
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive
hybrids without being smug about it.

380
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:26,243
But for now...
the technology is just too much for us.

381
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,669
Come on, everybody!
Let's go buy wasterful gas guzzlers!

382
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:35,211
Well, looks like you're
back for good, huh Kyle?

383
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,489
Yeah, I guess so.

384
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:39,658
We just can't get rid of you, can we,
you sneaky Jew rat!

385
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:42,338
Don't belitle my people, you fucking fatass!

386
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:45,078
Ah, that's better.
