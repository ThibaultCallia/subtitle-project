1
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:40,094
Mrs. Cartman, we have had it
with your son's behavior, mkay?!

2
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:43,552
Little Billy Turner is now
being treated at the hospital!

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,492
Eric, why would you do such a thing?

4
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,253
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's
ankle to the school flagpole.

5
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,897
You know that's not the point!

6
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,970
Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed
Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,848
and then gave him a hacksaw.
And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk

8
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,669
and that the only way he could get to the
antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.

9
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:04,011
That's very naughty, Eric.
- Well he called me chubby!

10
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:07,817
We have tried at this school to make Eric
understand that there are boundaries, mkay?!

11
00:01:07,845 --> 00:01:11,565
But frankly, we believe his
behavioral problems start at home!

12
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,564
I know.
I know he's out of control.

13
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:17,215
But... you don't know what it's like.

14
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,217
I'm sorry. It's just that...
he seems to get worse every day.

15
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:28,675
He just never listens.

16
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,328
Well nice goin', asshole!
You made my mom cry!

17
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:37,370
It's not him, it's you, Eric.

18
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:39,863
I don't know what to do with you.

19
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,293
Sure you do.
You're a great mom.

20
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:45,498
Who's got the greatest mom in the world?
I do.

21
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:48,945
My mom is number one in my heart.
It's true!

22
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:51,709
My mom's the best mom,
better than your mom.

23
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,696
It's singing together in harmony.

24
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:57,612
Mrs. Cartman,
I know this is extremely difficult

25
00:01:57,654 --> 00:02:00,534
but there is help out there for people like you.

26
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:05,103
Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?

27
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:10,796
They're every parent's worst nightmare.

28
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,908
Shut up!
I hate you! I hate you!

29
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,227
Kids completely out of control.

30
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,651
Look, I'm skating, I'm skating!

31
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,665
It's time to call Nanny 911.

32
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,019
We've gathered a team of world-class
nannies to help families in crisis.

33
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:31,803
Parents of America, help is on the way!

34
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:35,952
Tonight...
- Mom, I need another energy drink!

35
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:39,286
This eight year old son of
a single parent just won't behave.

36
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:41,902
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!

37
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:45,513
And Nanny Stella is selected
to set him straight.

38
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,834
It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman
his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore!

39
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,858
Mom, are you deaf?!
Somebody's at the door!

40
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,789
Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins.

41
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,180
Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now.

42
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,819
Hello.
I'm Nanny Stella.

43
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:10,203
Oh, thank you so much for coming.
Please come in.

44
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:13,748
And you must be Eric.

45
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,512
Mom, I want a Twinkie.
- All, all right dear.

46
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:20,920
Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be
some rule changes around here, Eric.

47
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:24,420
First of all, no video games
until chores are done.

48
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:26,976
Hah! Hahahaha!

49
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:30,615
I'm serious. Let's put down the video game
and go to the kitchen.

50
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:32,532
No thanks, I'd rather naught.

51
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,811
Right. Then I'm going to have to take it.

52
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,675
The hell do you think you're doing?
- Come on.

53
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:42,609
This video game is going right here on
the counter until we've done some chores.

54
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:45,804
Now, first thing we're going
to do is make your bed.

55
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:49,345
Eric, no!
This is not acceptable!

56
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:51,745
Stop trying to bogart my X-Box, you fat bitch!

57
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,961
All right, that's it!
You're going to time-out!

58
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:56,110
Time out?

59
00:03:56,253 --> 00:04:00,739
Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are
going to sit on this stool for five minutes.

60
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,437
And what exactly keeps me on the stool?

61
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:08,312
It's the time-out stool.
You can't get down until the time is up.

62
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,626
Whoa, how did I do that?

63
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,229
Eric, you have to stay in time-out!

64
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:18,812
Ummm, no?

65
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:20,937
Come on, you don't have a choice.

66
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,388
All right, seriously,
you're starting to piss me off now.

67
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,582
Eric, you need to listen to me.
This is very important.

68
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,959
I am getting down to eye level with Eric
so that I can talk to him on his level.

69
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:34,973
Eric, you need to understand why
you are being punished. All right?

70
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,931
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.

71
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:40,014
Well then, I'll just have to stand right here!

72
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:42,459
Oh!

73
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:45,239
He spit in my mouth!

74
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:47,836
Yeah, it's best to avoid his level.

75
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:52,702
All right! I've dealt with this before!
We just need to use psychology on him!

76
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:57,549
<i>Don't stop believing.
Hold on to that feeling.</i>

77
00:04:57,577 --> 00:05:00,646
Eric, can I just talk
to you for a quick second?

78
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,914
Why are you so angry?
- Because you took my X-Box.

79
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,191
Is this about more than your video game?

80
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:11,139
Are you feeling angry at me because
you think I'm here to change your life?

81
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,445
Well, yeah.

82
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:17,598
And you're feeling like I have no right
to come in and tell you how to live.

83
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,590
Yeah. I guess so.

84
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:23,743
See this? You have to take the time to talk
to your children about their feelings.

85
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,964
What else are you feeling, Eric?

86
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:30,765
Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't
understand why you became a nanny.

87
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:35,307
Me?
Well, it's because I love children, like you.

88
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:39,765
Right, but... if you love children so much,
how come you're not a mommy?

89
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:43,414
Oh, I just never had kids.
- Why not?

90
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,402
It... just... didn't happen.

91
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,884
You're sterile, is that it?

92
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,631
No, that's too convenient of an excuse.

93
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:55,159
The truth is, nobody ever wanted
to have babies with you. Isn't that it?

94
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,549
Always  the mom's maid and never the mom?

95
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,549
Must be hard on you,
knowing that the years are ticking away.

96
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:04,161
Your friends all getting married and all the
while your uterus is slowly shriveling away.

97
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:06,978
Drying up, becoming totally worthless.

98
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:12,384
Why you, you... you little bastard!
How dare you?!

99
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,345
Eric, naughty.
- What kind of monster would-

100
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:18,217
Yes,  let the anger come!
Strike me down while you can!

101
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:20,560
But it won't make your
dried-up ovaries any more fertile!

102
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:22,679
That's it!
I'm not doing this!

103
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,453
Oh, but we really need some help.

104
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:28,035
Find yourself another nanny... televison show!

105
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:31,598
Coming up next, it's Super Nanny!

106
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,643
Where other nannies fail,
Nanny Jo comes through.

107
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:48,337
This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!

108
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,425
But there's no trial
too tough for Super Nanny!

109
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:57,148
In just three days' time you're
going to see a new Eric Cartman.

110
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:00,016
Three Days Later

111
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:02,144
<i>Slater-Carey Mental Hospital</i>

112
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:06,092
I'm afraid Super Nanny is in
a deep state of mental psychosis.

113
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,259
What do you mean?

114
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:11,342
I mean, she spends most of her time
sobbing and eating her own excrement.

115
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:19,159
From heeell!
It's from heeell!

116
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,825
Oh dear. I don't know what else to do
about my son's behavioral problems.

117
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:28,186
We've been through every
nanny reality show on television.

118
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:31,798
Wull there... is...
one more show you could still try.

119
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:34,100
<i>Dog Whisperer</i>

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,323
When good dogs go bad,
there's one man who's their best friend.

121
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:39,878
Cesar Millan.

122
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:42,771
No dog is too much for me to handle.

123
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,590
I rehabilitate dogs,
I train people.

124
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:48,202
I am the dog wheesperer.

125
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:53,195
Please, come in.

126
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,264
So tell me what are the problems
you are having with the child?

127
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:58,533
Well, he's just... out of control.

128
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:01,618
I mean, he never listens to me
and he pretty much runs my life.

129
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:05,146
So the child needs to learn that he's not
the most important person in the house.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,549
You can stop talkin' behind my back,
I'm right here, fruitcake.

131
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,242
See I'm not looking at the child,
I'm not acknowledging the child.

132
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:12,282
I'm just letting the child know
I'm not interested in him.

133
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:13,605
Not interested im me?

134
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,952
See the child thinks your world
revolves around him, because it does.

135
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:19,504
Because everything he does
gets a response from you.

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,882
Yeah, well I don't see why-

137
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,513
Hey!

138
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,087
Don't look at the child,
just keep looking at me.

139
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:25,047
Let, let him know we
are having a conversation.

140
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:26,078
Mom, this guy doesn't-

141
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:28,262
Ah! Quit it!
- What what is it that you're doing?

142
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:30,899
Dogs show their dominance
by nipping each other on the neck

143
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,622
but it works equally well on a child.

144
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,270
I just use two fingers, nip at
the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child

145
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,654
just let him know I am dominant.

146
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:39,017
Look, Mexican,
if you really think that you can-

147
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,059
Knock it off!

148
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:44,873
See, I'm not validating his bad behavior
with either negative or positive response.

149
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,512
Oh, that's very interesting.

150
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,416
I think the first thing we need to work
on is getting the child some exercise.

151
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:50,883
He's fat and he has all
this pent-up energy that-

152
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:53,046
I'm not fat!
- We need to let him burn off.

153
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,894
Do you take walks with your son?
- Well, no, I don't.

154
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,167
Go on, take your son for a walk.

155
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:01,996
Ey! You think this is funny,
you sonofabitch?

156
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:03,788
Once again,
I am the one going for a walk.

157
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,343
It's about me,
the child is lucky to come along.

158
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:07,996
Mom, this is degrading!

159
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:10,760
Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh!

160
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,516
Don't look at him, just look straight ahead
and he'll run out of evergy soon.

161
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:29,595
Maaaa. Mommm.
Mommm.

162
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:31,998
Here, why don't you try it now.
Take your son.

163
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:34,217
Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!

164
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:37,064
Good. Just keep your confidence,
shoulders back, eyes straight ahead.

165
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:38,827
The child can pick up on that confidence

166
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,967
learning he's supposed to follow you,
not lead you.

167
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:44,022
Mom, don't you love me?
Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?

168
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:45,434
Mom!

169
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,656
Good, Ms. Cartman.
Very good!

170
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:52,207
And now, back to the Dog Whispererrrrr.

171
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,554
It is important to understand
that dogs run in packs.

172
00:09:56,693 --> 00:10:00,845
And one dog is always dominant,
the pack leader.

173
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,510
God damnit, stop ignoring me!

174
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:06,690
You must assert yourself as
pack leader with dominant energy.

175
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:07,594
Ah allright.

176
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:11,010
This is abuse!
I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!

177
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:12,721
Quit it, mom!

178
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:15,068
It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.

179
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:18,291
Okay, let me show you how
to express the dominant energy.

180
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:22,166
What I have done is I have brought
over some Kentucky Fried Chicken.

181
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:23,601
Ooo, Colonel?

182
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:26,851
I am going to eat first,
because that is what the pack leader does.

183
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:29,073
Give, give me the chicken.
Give me some chicken.

184
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,566
Eh, what are you doing?
I want chicken!

185
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:32,803
Give me some Goddamned chicken!

186
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,998
I am not going to acknowledge the child's
attempt at aggressive dominant behavior.

187
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,533
Now you eat the chicken.

188
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:41,060
Mom, gimme, give me some chicken.
I want some chicken, Mom!

189
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:44,241
We  won't reward him until he's
in a calm submissive behavior.

190
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,185
Goddamnit, I am not a dog!

191
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:49,186
Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me
the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!

192
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,992
We need him to become relaxed and submissive.

193
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:58,376
Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now.
May I have some chicken please?

194
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,126
Oh, very good, sweetie.

195
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:03,931
Oh  no, now he's lying. You can tell from
his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.

196
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,917
Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
- See?

197
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:10,832
Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat
KFC in front of me! Now hand it over!

198
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,150
You can't do that to me, I-

199
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,193
Goddamnit, you just can't-

200
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:15,424
Seriously!
Ey? Eh...

201
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:21,170
I am not being aggressive,
I am being dominant.

202
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:23,115
Wow, I have a lot to learn.

203
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:26,467
Mom, I am serious!
This has gone on long enough!

204
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:28,911
Get that guy out of here
and give me a piece of chicken!

205
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,405
That's how you want it, bitch?!
Fine!

206
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:35,324
I hate you!
I'm running away!

207
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,424
Oh, dear.

208
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:39,563
It's okay, this is all part
of the domance struggle.

209
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:42,535
But what if he does run away.
- Let him go. He'll be back.

210
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,816
This a good opportunity for you to relax
and enjoy your favorite hobby.

211
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,177
Oh boy, Park Avenue!
I'm rich!

212
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:54,325
Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.

213
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:57,006
I ran away from home.

214
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,473
Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care
about me anymore, so I moved out.

215
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:05,074
She didn't even try to stop me.
It's gonna be tough livin' on my own.

216
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:06,887
But I'll get by, somehow.

217
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:08,498
You can't stay here.

218
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,554
Maybe you didn't hear me!
I ran away!

219
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,675
I don't have anywhere to sleep!
I'm out on the street!

220
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:14,383
You're not staying at my house either.

221
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:17,384
All right, that's fine!
Butters, I'll crash with you.

222
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:20,050
No, my parents won't let me bring
homeless people home anymore.

223
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:23,418
Well what do you guys expect me to do?!
Stay at Kenny's house?!

224
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:25,848
His family's totally poor.
I'm not staying with poor people!

225
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,071
All right, I'll stay with Kenny.
Let's go, man.

226
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:31,529
Fuck you.

227
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,802
Och! Well, I guess now we see
just how supportive friends can be!

228
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,041
When the chips are down
you won't even lend a hand!

229
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,736
I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!

230
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:43,361
Out in the cold! Probably get mugged
and gang-raped by some minorities!

231
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,992
You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead!

232
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:49,649
Whoopie! G and R Railroad!

233
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:56,185
Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe
this, but... I ran away from home.

234
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:59,699
I just... I really need the support
of my best friend right now.

235
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,579
Who is your best friend?

236
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,204
You are, Jimmy!
We've always been best friends.

237
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:06,704
We know everything about each other.

238
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:10,294
What's my last name?

239
00:13:12,836 --> 00:13:13,947
Goddamnit!

240
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:18,372
Craig, dude, I ran away from home.

241
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:21,844
You're the first person I came to.
I knew you'd take me in off the streets.

242
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,184
But I hate you.

243
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,600
Should that really matter at a time like this?

244
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:36,214
This is bullcrap!
Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.

245
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,729
All right, I'm back.

246
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,662
Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.

247
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:46,660
Yes, well, hopefully you've
learned your lesson!

248
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:49,136
I've come back, but there's going
to be some changes around here.

249
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:52,302
Look what I did, Eric.
I learned how to make Sumie paintings.

250
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,464
I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.

251
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:55,886
That's super-interesting.

252
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:58,597
But I've been out living in
the streets for almost four hours!

253
00:13:58,624 --> 00:13:59,902
Make me something to eat.

254
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,041
Cesar...
- How is the painting going?

255
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:03,263
Aw,  Goddamnit!

256
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,958
Oh look it came back.
- Yup, just like you said he would.

257
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,335
What is he still doing here?!

258
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:09,891
He said he's hungry. What should I do?
- Well let's feed it.

259
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:15,779
What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken,
boiled vegetables and salad?!

260
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,390
This is just like Auschwitz!

261
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,778
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior.
Don't nurture it.

262
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:23,153
Oh my God.
Bite-size Snickers?

263
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:25,972
That's it.
I'm calling child-protective services!

264
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,972
Come on, Ms. Cartman,
you must become pack leader.

265
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:30,917
What do you do?

266
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,852
Eric, if you don't want to eat then

267
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,825
why don't you go brush your teeth
and go to bed?!

268
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,255
Nooo, you're asking him a favor.
Don't ask a favor, dominate!

269
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,841
Mom, I want this guy out of here!
You got it?

270
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:44,577
If he's not gone, in two minutes,
I will call social services on you!

271
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:48,725
You project the dominant energy
and he will pick up on it. I promise.

272
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:52,433
Shoulder back, head high,
don't reason with it

273
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,407
don't argue with it, just dominate it.

274
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,819
I am your son
and you will listen to me!

275
00:14:57,871 --> 00:14:59,110
You have no right to-

276
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:01,096
Mon, know it off!
I'm not gonna stand for th-

277
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,943
Seriously! Mom-

278
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,935
Why are you... doing this?

279
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:07,399
Mom?!
Mom? Mom...

280
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:10,190
I did it!

281
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,724
You see?
You're calm, assertive and in control.

282
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:22,398
Oh... Oh my gosh!

283
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:25,010
See?
This is the behavior we've been looking for.

284
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,196
This is a relaxed, submissive state.

285
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:29,185
He's never done this before.

286
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:32,293
Good. Now you can reward
the behavior with praise and attention.

287
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:35,988
I love you very much, poopsiekins.
You're Mommy's sunshine.

288
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,932
Now you can give him a snack.

289
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,406
Good, this is reeally good.
Now try a command.

290
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,350
Eric, I want you to go upstairs
and brush your teeth.

291
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:50,370
Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.

292
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,623
Oh my goodness.
I can't believe it.

293
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,137
This is a great first step, but you're
gonna have to stay firm and confident.

294
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:07,123
You are the pack leader now.
- I am the pack leader!

295
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:10,859
Now before you go read your son his story
let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.

296
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,567
Sounds divine!

297
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:15,609
Who does she think telling
me to go brush my teeth?!

298
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:25,100
Jesus. What's happening to me?

299
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,343
So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?

300
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,106
Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar.

301
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:36,442
He got an A on his last spelling test
and a B+ in history.

302
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:38,794
He's losing weight
and he's doing what I tell him.

303
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,660
Thats great!

304
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,590
The best part is I'm not letting
him boss me around anymore.

305
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:43,946
I could have never come out

306
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:47,100
and have a nice lunch on a Saturday
afternoon with a friend before.

307
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:51,187
Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating
your son like a son and not like a friend.

308
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:55,400
There's just one problem,
he still fights me every step of the way.

309
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:57,607
I feel like he's doing what I tell him

310
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:01,368
but that inside he's still
the same angry spoiled child.

311
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,129
Don't worry.

312
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:06,451
When you correct the behavior, eventually you
will see a change in the personality.

313
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:09,708
Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life.

314
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:17,947
Guys, listen up.
I really need your help this time.

315
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:21,552
I've thought about it a lot
and I've decided I have to kill my mom.

316
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,403
Kill your mom?

317
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:26,889
She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore.
Things have really gotten out of hand!

318
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,610
My mom must die so I can have a place to live,
but without her trying to run my life.

319
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,735
She's like Hitler with all
the demands she makes.

320
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:36,204
Dude, have you lost more weight?
- Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now.

321
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:39,802
You see what I mean?? I totally know how
it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now!

322
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,898
I have to kill my mom.
It's my only way out.

323
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:43,788
Dude, don't kill your mom.
That's not cool.

324
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,757
She's Hitler! Would you have
killed Hitler if you had the chance?!

325
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:48,075
All right now, here's the plan.

326
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:50,773
At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out
of my room and leave the house

327
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:52,152
leaving the back door unlocked.

328
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,649
You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp

329
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,451
having  given me enough time to get down
to Perkins to be seen by everyone there.

330
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,806
And then all four of you
go upstairs to kill my mom.

331
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,304
Dude, we're not killing your mom.

332
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:03,712
Well I can't kill her.
I'm too obvious a suspect.

333
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:05,608
Now, when you reach her room,
Butters will keep a lookout

334
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:08,197
while Kenny opens the bedroom door,
Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head

335
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:09,718
and Stan shoots her in the face.

336
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,774
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
- Well I don't know.

337
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,093
That's your job, Stan!
Do I have to think of everything here?!

338
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:15,326
I'm not shooting anybody.

339
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,616
Okay, fine. Butters,
you cover my mom's head with a pillow

340
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:18,778
and Kyle can shoot her in the face.

341
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:19,868
No, Cartman!

342
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,426
Oh! Well how about I do everything?!
How does that sound?!

343
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:24,745
I'll just do everything while you guys
sit here and play video games?!

344
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,092
Fine! I'll do it by myself!

345
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:47,230
You forced me to do this!
You couldn't just love me as a son.

346
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,674
You just had to humiliate
and degrade me with your rules.

347
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:52,909
I won't let you dominate my life anymore!

348
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,542
Goodbye, Mother.

349
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:00,380
Wait.

350
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:04,394
Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.

351
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,912
No! She's my mom,
I can do whatever I want with her!

352
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,120
It's more important that I live the way I want!

353
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,638
<i>She isn't an object you can own.
She's a human being.</i>

354
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:15,112
She isn't an object you can own.
She's a human being.

355
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:17,723
<i>No, she's just... out to make you suffer!</i>

356
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:21,976
Maybe all these changes are good for me.
Maybe...

357
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,254
<i>The world doesn't revolve around me?</i>

358
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,842
Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me.

359
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:37,675
<i>The world doesn't revolve around me!</i>

360
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,258
<i>Idiot!</i>

361
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:06,667
Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.

362
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,931
Yeah Mom, it's okay.
It's grapefruit and lean han.

363
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,014
And you're studying before school?

364
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,276
Well, you told me I had to review
my homework before class started.

365
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:18,283
Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you.

366
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,568
Tha... thank you?

367
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,915
I love you, sweetie.

368
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:23,818
'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez.

369
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,622
Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.

370
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:31,191
How is the child doing?

371
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34,929
Oh, he's amazing.
I think the change in personality happened.

372
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,548
He's doing things for himself now
and he seems to be accepting it.

373
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:41,524
I've lost a best friend,
but I've gained a son.

374
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:45,463
That's much healthier for him and when he gets
older he'll be able to be your friend too.

375
00:20:45,563 --> 00:20:46,976
You're the best, Cesar.

376
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:49,893
and to show my gratitude I've got
two tickets for you and me

377
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:52,191
to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.

378
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:55,038
Well no, my work is done.
I've got to get back to Los Angeles.

379
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:59,037
Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.

380
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:02,664
No, not really. You're just a client.
Well, good luck to you. Gotta go.

381
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,582
I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna
go upstairs and make my bed now.

382
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:17,000
Eric, how would you like to go with me
to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?

383
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,162
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle
we could work on our science project then.

384
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:24,753
Well, what if I took you to
Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?

385
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,663
And then we'll go to Target
and I buy you a Mega Ranger.

386
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:34,444
Could I... perhaps have...
two Mega Rangers?

387
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:38,213
Yes, darling.
You can have whatever you want.
