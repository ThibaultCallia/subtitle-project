1
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,576
And so, class, that is when Joe Lee
countered back to Aniston and said things like-

2
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,310
Oh hello Mr. Mackey.

3
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:47,373
All the girls go out in the hall please?

4
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:50,391
I need to speak with
the boys of this class, m'kay?

5
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:55,957
Boys, we have a very serious problem!

6
00:00:55,986 --> 00:01:02,173
I've just come from the men's restroom
and somebody went number 2 in the urinal!

7
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,942
What's an urinal?
- A wall toilet for peeing in.

8
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,691
And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay?

9
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:13,641
Now I want whoever did it
to come forward right now

10
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:17,151
and it will be less painful
for everybody! M'kay?!

11
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:20,940
Who would take a ddump in a urinal?
It's such a s-senseless crime.

12
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,871
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to
entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy.

13
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:27,450
Just like 9/11.
- Oh God, here we go again!

14
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:30,512
Nine-eleven was not a conspiracy, fatass!
- Oh really?!

15
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:33,563
Do you just believe everything you're tolk, Kyle?
- Excuse me!

16
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,482
Could we get back to the issue, please?!

17
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:39,061
You all don't seem to understand
how serious this is!

18
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:41,320
Now who made dookie in the urinal?!

19
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:46,022
Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!
M'kay! M'kay!

20
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:49,261
You're gonna think it's real funny
when the police get here!

21
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:53,412
I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just
isn't really any evidence to go on.

22
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,460
But there must have been some motive.

23
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:58,462
Nobody would just dook
in the urinal for no reason.

24
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:01,511
But who would benefit
from crapping in the urinal?

25
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:05,721
Uh this is too big a mystery for me.
I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.

26
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:16,080
<i>The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers
with a knack for solving mysteries.</i>

27
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:20,802
<i>The Hardly Boys in:
"The Mystery of the Urinal Turd".</i>

28
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:25,431
So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no
leads and nobody admitting to the crime.

29
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:29,613
That sure is a mystery.
- Yeah, it sounds super-hard.

30
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,522
Whoever did it must have
been angry with the school.

31
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:37,512
I think I'm getting a clue.
- Really?

32
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:40,563
Yeah, this is totally giving
me a clue right now.

33
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,792
I'm starting to get a clue too.
- My clue is kind of pointing this way.

34
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:49,340
Yeah, now I've got a total clue.

35
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:51,633
I've still got a raging clue.

36
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:56,373
My clue's pointing over there now!
- Oh, let's follow that clue!

37
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:04,653
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
- Not yet.

38
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,552
They aren't going to find out who did it.

39
00:03:06,606 --> 00:03:10,072
But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him
to detention, and make us all believe it.

40
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,880
It'll be 9/11 all over again.

41
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:15,660
Will you shut up about 9/11!
- Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!

42
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,931
Because anybody who thinks 9/11
was a conspiracy is a retard!

43
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:19,873
Oh really?

44
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:23,720
Well did you know that over one-fourth of people
in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy?

45
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,220
Are you saying that one-fourth
of Americans are retards?

46
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:28,900
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth
of Americans are retards.

47
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:30,263
Yeah, at least one-fourth.

48
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:34,493
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us,
you're a retard, that's one-fourth.

49
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:37,763
There are soo many people who
know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters!

50
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:38,970
Hey, fellas!

51
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,940
Butters, do you think 9/11 was
just a plot by some angry terrorists

52
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:43,672
or do you think there was some kind of coverup?

53
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:47,421
Well, I heard that 9/11 was
caused by President Bush.

54
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,841
Aha! Do you see?
- Where did you hear that?

55
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:52,241
From Eric.
- I rest my case.

56
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:54,511
Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?

57
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:56,843
Well, l-uh, I mean, uu, you never know.

58
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:58,991
Uh the government does some pretty spooky things.

59
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:02,602
The government and the corporations
headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11

60
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,690
That's right, Butters.
- Goddamnit!

61
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:07,231
You see what happens when
you spread this stupid crap, fatass?!

62
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,471
What?! People see the truth?!

63
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:10,463
Can I go now?
- You guys are blind!

64
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:13,540
I can't believe that everyone here is just
buying into what they're told by the media!

65
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,210
I'm gonna go find out the truth.

66
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:18,143
I'm gonna blow the lid off this
whole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all!

67
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:19,732
Oh no...

68
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,993
<i>It is wrong for me to ask questions?</i>

69
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:29,361
<i>Is  it wrong to seek the truth?</i>

70
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,672
<i>I just can't blindly accept their version.</i>

71
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:36,000
<i>I can't base my logic on proof.</i>

72
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:39,092
<i>Almost all the evidence points one way.</i>

73
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:42,903
<i>But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan.</i>

74
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:49,061
<i>I need to know what really happened
On 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.</i>

75
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:53,573
<i>What really happened
On 9/11?</i>

76
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:58,162
Of course. It's so obvious.

77
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,790
How did we not see it before?

78
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,480
This is my frog he doesn't have a name.

79
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:08,093
He's a frog not a toad because toads
don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets.

80
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:14,700
Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing
your dumb little frog with the class.

81
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:17,743
Okay, anybody else have
anything for Show and Tell?

82
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:23,002
All right, Eric, you can go next.

83
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:28,231
For Show and Tell today I have brought...

84
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,081
my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth...

85
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:33,330
behind the 9/11 attacks!

86
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:35,310
Oh Christ.

87
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:39,812
We are told to believe that the fire from the
jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers

88
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:41,373
which led to their collapse.

89
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:45,303
But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at
a high enough temperature to melt steel?

90
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:48,782
We were told the Pentagon was
hit by a hijacked plane as well

91
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:51,752
but now look at this photo of the Pentagon.
The hole is not nearly big enough.

92
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:54,820
And if a plane hit it,
where is the rest of the plane?

93
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:59,902
So now, the inevitable question:
if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?

94
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:02,023
Remember that there are in fact two towers.

95
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,530
Two minus one is one; one one - 11.

96
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,192
Two minus one is one, one one.

97
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:09,330
and there are nine members
on Silverstein's board of directors.

98
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,932
That's nine-one-one.
Nine-eleven.

99
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:16,133
And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12

100
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:20,201
which leads us all to
the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.

101
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,150
Kyle!

102
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:23,553
Me?

103
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:25,393
Twelve contains the numbers one and two

104
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:28,483
just like the toilet yesterday where womebody
went number two instead of number one!

105
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:33,102
And one and two with 911 and you get 914!
Drop the 4 and it's 91!

106
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:36,781
Exactly the score Kyle got on his
spelling test twelve days after 9/11!

107
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:39,042
Who has the most to gain from 9/11?!
Kyle!

108
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,831
Who was nowhere to be found
the morning the towers fell?! Kyle!

109
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:44,103
Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?!
Kyle!

110
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:48,441
But probably the most damning of all is
the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!

111
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:53,241
When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared
to be a blur, but when I computer-enhanced it.

112
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:58,073
You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.

113
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,032
Hey Token.

114
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,903
You you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters.

115
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:17,630
All right, all right,
I was not responsible for 9/11!

116
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,082
God-damnit!

117
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,612
Hello bubbe, how was school today?
- Terrible.

118
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,142
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.

119
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:32,123
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.

120
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:33,861
Whatwhatwhaaat?!

121
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:35,882
We have to do something!

122
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:39,742
It is obvious our children are
still completely confused about 9/11!

123
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:44,360
Yes, we need to go over it again in the class-
room so they understand what really happened.

124
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:46,670
Well, what really happened?

125
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:50,480
There's  strong evidence that
what we were told isn't the truth.

126
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,120
Oh no, oh brother, oh God.

127
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:57,203
That's right. Did you know that there were
explosions seen at the base of the towers?

128
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:58,993
Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded.

129
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:01,040
Look, what-ever you believe

130
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,591
the fact of the matter is somebody...

131
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,612
dropped a dookie in the school urinal
and there's still no explanation for that!

132
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,431
Mr. Mackey, there are more
important things going on here!

133
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:11,652
More important?!

134
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:15,443
You aren't the one, who had to walk
into the boys' bathroom, okay.

135
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:18,161
After having tuh, to wake up early, you know.

136
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,783
There's no, no coffee in
the teachers' lounge, and then you

137
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:24,531
you walk into the bathroom just to find
a big dook laying there in the urinal!

138
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,327
Like it's laughin' at you!

139
00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:30,021
He's right! The turd could have
been put there to cover up 9/11!

140
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:34,160
No, I'm not saying they're related!
- How do we know they're not?

141
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:37,750
We need to be brave enough to ask questions!

142
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,282
It's obvious that before we go any further

143
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:43,662
we need to find out who was
behind 9/11 once and for all!

144
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:47,371
Who else could it have been?
- This is too big a mystery for me.

145
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:51,653
I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
- Oh no, not the Goddamend-

146
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:56,342
<i>The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers
with a knack for solving mysteries.</i>

147
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,782
<i>The Hardly Boys in:</i>

148
00:08:57,816 --> 00:09:01,173
<i>The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy.</i>

149
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,793
So that's about the long
and short of it, Hardly Boys.

150
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:07,191
There were two towers that
stood right here and they're gone.

151
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:09,501
And  nobody knows who's responsible?

152
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,682
There are theories, but, nobody's certain.

153
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,823
Who would benefit most from
two buildings disappearing?

154
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:19,443
I just started getting a clue.
- Really?

155
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:22,300
Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue.

156
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:27,202
Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah,
I've got a raging clue right now.

157
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,223
Mine's pointing to the left.

158
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:34,503
Oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging
clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.

159
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,060
Okay, let's follow your raging clue.

160
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:40,833
Godspeed.

161
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:57,982
Kyle!
- Aaaah!

162
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:58,612
Dude!

163
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:02,133
Do you mind telling me why CIA guys are coming
to my house and questioning me about you?

164
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:05,852
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's
putting pieces together that aren't there.

165
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,541
Well why did you have to involve me?
- It's not my fault.

166
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:10,642
All right, look, I've been doing
a lot of research on the Web

167
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:13,883
and I found an organization who says they
can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.

168
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,343
Really?
- Come on.

169
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,202
We'l go out the back so they don't see you.

170
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:22,521
There's just one thing I need to know before
we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?

171
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:26,330
Dude.

172
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:28,550
That's all I needed.

173
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:35,962
Now you might all think I've given up finding
out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay?

174
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,370
And maybe, maybe you
think it's a victimless crime.

175
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:43,433
This, is Mr. Venezuela, the school janitor.
Okay?

176
00:10:43,587 --> 00:10:45,940
He's the person...
who has to clean up...

177
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:49,411
when some trickster...
drops a dook in the wrong toilet!

178
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:54,171
Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks
an hour at best! Okay?

179
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:57,682
He's got three kids at home,
he's got a car that barely works.

180
00:10:57,687 --> 00:11:01,082
He's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay.

181
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:05,732
Then he walks into the boys' room and sees
a big meaty chud starin' 'him in the face!

182
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:08,872
So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay.

183
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,180
You might as well have just drropped your pants

184
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:14,183
and laid a turd right on top
of Mr. Venezuela's head!

185
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:19,082
Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!
- Mr. Mackey!

186
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,881
We got him.
- Huh?

187
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:23,111
We caught the person that did it.

188
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:34,173
Hi, we were hoping you can help us.
My friend is being blamed for 9/11.

189
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:36,943
Aw geez. Come on in, kids.

190
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:41,173
It doesn't surprise me. More and more
people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.

191
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:41,943
They are?

192
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:45,363
Yeah, it a way of keeping people
from seeing the real evidence.

193
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:49,083
I know it seems crazy, but 9/11
was pulled off by our own government

194
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:51,780
so they could gain support
for attacking the Middle East.

195
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:54,621
What? No no no.
- know it's hard to believe.

196
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,743
Dude, why would the government
attack its own buildings?

197
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:01,021
It's called the False Flag policy.
Make it look like the enemy attacked you.

198
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:04,151
Get all your citizens riled up
and waving American flags.

199
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:07,100
Then you're free to invade any country you want.

200
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:09,370
That's retarded.

201
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,283
Look into the evidence of 9/11 and you'll
see there are a lot of holes in their story.

202
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,243
There's a lot of holes in the Theory
of Evolution too, it doesn't mean it's wrong.

203
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:19,512
You don't understand!
The government controls everything.

204
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:23,482
The media, the corporations, they have
the power to do anything they want.

205
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:27,610
Here, look!
Read the labels on these! Go on, read them!

206
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,342
Code 234.

207
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:32,533
We think they came from a governmentn office.
- What is it?

208
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:35,133
It's Anthrax.
- Anthrax?!

209
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:37,272
Someday we'll use it as evidence against them.

210
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:39,461
Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!

211
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:46,853
Aw, aw, awww!

212
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:51,032
Why, Clyde?
Why did you do it?

213
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:53,333
I don't know.

214
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:56,221
You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay?

215
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:59,283
You got over three hundred people
that need to use the boys' room.

216
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,903
Then you decide you're
gonna be a comedian, m'kay.

217
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:05,942
And pinch one off in the urinal and leave it
layin' there for everyone to have to look at!

218
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:10,530
Okay okay, you think it's funny,
but nobody else does!

219
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:13,231
They gotta walk in that bathroom
and see your rancid dook

220
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:16,320
propped up against the back
of the urinal like a brown rag doll!

221
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:21,290
Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here.
- M'kay, that's good!

222
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:24,401
Let's see what your mom and dad have
to say about your little poopscapade!

223
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:27,521
Come on in, please.
I'm just trying to get your son to explain why

224
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:29,872
he would drop a dook in the urinal!

225
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:31,831
Mr. Mackey.

226
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:34,201
There's something you should know...

227
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:42,573
Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.

228
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:45,163
Come on in, Mr. President.

229
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,542
Uh, Mr. President, my name is-
- SSHHUUDDUUPP!

230
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:54,831
You think we don't know your name?!
We know everything! We control everything!

231
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:59,590
We've all worked very hard to keep
our involvement in 9/11 a secret!

232
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:02,132
But you just had to keep digging!

233
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:03,630
R eally?

234
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:07,353
You won't get away with it! People know!
- People?

235
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:09,041
You mean sheeple.

236
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:12,411
We have the majority of them
kept in blissful ignorance.

237
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:16,023
Just one more... leak... to fix.

238
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:17,921
Wait. What are you doing?

239
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,792
You've been a thorn in our
side for too long, I'm afraid.

240
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:23,111
No! You can't do this!

241
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:27,223
Please! I'll stop.
I'll take down the Web site. I'll sto-

242
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:29,621
Oh no! Oh no!

243
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,852
Too late.

244
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,390
Jesus Christ!

245
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:40,392
He died like a pig.
- Some pigs never learn.

246
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:42,871
No... way.

247
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,760
He was right.
You did cause 9/11.

248
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:49,082
Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really.

249
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:53,201
All I had to do was have explosives
planted in the base of the towers.

250
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:56,403
Then on 9/11 we pretended like
four planes were being hijacked.

251
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,652
When really we just rerouted
them to Pennsylvania.

252
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:01,892
Then flew two military jets into the World
Trade Center filled with more explosives

253
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,560
then shot down all the witnesses
of Flight 93 with an F-15

254
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:07,081
after blowing up the Pentagon
with a Cruise missile.

255
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:12,623
It was only the world's most intricate
and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.

256
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,173
Really?
- Why?!

257
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,862
Oldest reason in the world. Money.

258
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:23,921
The towers fell and the American
sheeple all waved their flags.

259
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:29,421
Finally we could invade Iraq and get the oil
which made us all richer than before.

260
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,102
Beauutiful money, hahahaha!

261
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:35,941
Really?
- Is the whole government in on this?

262
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,953
We are all-knowing and all-powerful.

263
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:41,073
Good-bye, boys.

264
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:49,581
Dangit I missed again!
- For Christ's sake, Cheney!

265
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,992
Kyle!  Run!

266
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:55,672
Kill them!

267
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,891
Attention students.

268
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:03,582
Apparently, Clyde could not have
been the one who crapped in the urinal.

269
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:07,622
Because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay?

270
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,881
Now, whoever did this
unspeakable act is still at large.

271
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:15,193
The boys' bathroom is
closed until further notice

272
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:18,200
'cause one of you thought
it would be a good idea...

273
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:20,861
to pull down your pants... m'kay

274
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,503
over your buttcheeks over the urinal...

275
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,971
and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay?

276
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,421
Oh you think that's funny, huh?!

277
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:35,180
Let me assure you, there is nothing funny...
about going up to a nice, clean.

278
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,432
Unsuspectin' urinal, 'kay.

279
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:40,563
Droppin' your pants then... turnin' around...

280
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:42,742
squattin' over that urinal, 'kay.

281
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:46,380
Maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks
apart with your hands, m'kay.

282
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,253
And then layin' out a big fudge
dragon for all the world to see.

283
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:53,442
Oh yeah, that's real funny!

284
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:58,511
I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch
if it's the last thing I do! M'kay?!

285
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,963
All right, now we have to
switch over to Interbus 65.

286
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,932
We made it dude. We should be
home in less than eighteen hours.

287
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:15,943
Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
- It just... doesn't seem right.

288
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:19,553
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude.
It's like waking up for the first time.

289
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:23,933
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got
out of the White House pretty easily?

290
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:26,761
I mean, it seems like it would be pretty
hard to escape from the White House

291
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:29,380
with everyone chasing you
and we just kind of... ran out.

292
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:32,640
Well dude, maybe we're just superbadass.
Have you thought of that?

293
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:35,100
Hey!

294
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:39,802
Dude. You're alive?

295
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,032
Come back here!

296
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:51,092
Hey!
- Ogh!

297
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:05,771
No. Please. Pleeease!

298
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,860
Dude! What the hell is going on?!

299
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:10,460
Don't kill me!
I, I just do what they say!

300
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:14,753
What who said?
- I have an family. Please don't kill me!

301
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,943
Dude, we aren't going to kill you.

302
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,313
Oh God!
- It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!

303
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:25,433
Who the fuck are you?!
- There's no time! come on!

304
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,722
Do you mind telling us
what the hell is going on?

305
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,710
Who are you?
- I'm a detective.

306
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:39,222
And I'm afraid that you kids
have been double-crossed.

307
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:41,403
You f-figured this thing all out?

308
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:45,032
Not me. My mystery-solving sons.
Come on in, boys.

309
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:49,982
My boys were researching who went
number two in the urinal at your school

310
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:52,723
when they discovered something odd,
which gave them a clue.

311
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:54,530
Gave us both a clue.

312
00:18:54,627 --> 00:19:00,050
That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy
group party, where they got a lot more clues.

313
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:02,953
I was getting a clue like every two minutes.

314
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:07,360
I got such a raging clue that
I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.

315
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,531
Those clues pointed out that
all the 9/11 conspiracy theories

316
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,760
could be disproven scientifically.

317
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,000
And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.

318
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,453
It was huuuge.

319
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:22,601
That  all the 9/11 conspiracy websites
are run by the government.

320
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:25,021
The 9/11 conspiracy...

321
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,732
is a government conspiracy.

322
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:29,212
Aw Jesus...

323
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:32,032
Why would the government want
people to believe they caused 9/11?

324
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:35,523
For a government to have power,
they must appear to have complete control.

325
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,102
What better way to make people fear

326
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:40,343
them than to convince them they are
capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?

327
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,112
That's quite enough, Hardly!

328
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:46,362
Don't believe what he says, boys.
We caused 9/11.

329
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:51,292
It's all right here in these secret documents,
but you'll never get them.

330
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:58,903
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11
and you really didn't shoot that guy!

331
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:03,383
Boys, you don't understand.
People need to think we are all-powerful.

332
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:04,670
That we control the world.

333
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:08,790
If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11
then we appear to control nothing.

334
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:11,111
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!

335
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,650
We do that too.
And most people believe the truth.

336
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,570
But one fourth of the population is retarded.

337
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:21,941
If they wanna believe we control everything
with intricate plans, why not let them?

338
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:26,980
Just one thing, Mr. President:
How the devil did you know we were all here?

339
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,463
How come you couldn't just go home, dude?
That's all we had to do!

340
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,733
Stan!
What the fuck?!

341
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:39,583
It was all planned out!
- You knew this whole time?

342
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:40,811
Why?

343
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:42,750
Because it was me.

344
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:45,373
I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.

345
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:46,200
What?

346
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,363
The stalls were full
and I didn't wanna miss recess!

347
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:50,283
I didn't think it would turn
into such a big deal!

348
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:51,912
So you blamed the government?!

349
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:54,483
And the government was more
than willing to take the blame

350
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:57,621
so long as it made them
look responsible for 9/11!

351
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:00,421
Oh man, now everyone's gonna know.

352
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:03,632
Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have
to be so good at solving mysteries?

353
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:08,301
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal
and he contacted the conspiracy Web site?

354
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:10,472
But the conspiracy site
was run by the government?

355
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,332
Yuh.

356
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,373
So then, who was responsible for 9/11?

357
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,343
Whattaya mean?
A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.

358
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:17,032
Yeah. What are you, retarded?

359
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:25,273
Well, it looks like this mystery is solved.
It's time for the culprit to finally pay!

360
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:31,980
When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!

361
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:36,472
How would you feel...
if somebody came into your home, m'kay.

362
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:40,752
Pulled down their pants and laid a big
mud monkey right on your mom's face?

363
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:45,581
Oh you think that's funny, huh?!
Yeah, that's real funny!
