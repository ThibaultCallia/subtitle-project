1
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,800
M'kay, students, we have a very
special guest speaker today.

2
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,200
Who can tell me the name of
our country's last vice-president?

3
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Dick Cheney?

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,403
No, the last one.

5
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:49,800
Bill Clinton.

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,900
No, Clinton's vice-president.

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,500
He is here today to talk to you students
about some very serious issues.

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,804
Please welcome Al Gore.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,204
Who?

10
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:09,701
Thank you, Mr. Mackey,
students of South Park Elementary.

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,900
I'm here to educate you about
the single biggest threat to our planet.

12
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,100
You see...

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,600
there is something out there
which threatens our very existence

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,000
and may be the end of
the human race as we know it.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm talking of course about...
Manbearpig.

16
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,900
Manbearpig?

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,900
It is a creature which roams the earth alone.

18
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,800
It is half man, half bear
and half pig.

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,900
Some people say that Manbearpig isn't real.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,500
Well, I'm here to tell you know,
Manbearpig is very real

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,100
and he most certainly exists.

22
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,900
I'm cereal.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,800
Manbearpig doesn't care who
you are or what you've done.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Manbearpig simply wants to get you!

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,900
I'm super-cereal.

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,000
But have no fear,

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,900
because I am here to save you!

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,700
And someday,
when the world is rid of Manbearpig,

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,100
everyone will say "Thank you, Al Gore".

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
"You're super awesome".

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
The end.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,900
Thank you, class.

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Excelsior!

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
Check out this sweet move.

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,900
Kyle, you can't block like that.

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,300
Just play the game, fatass!

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,700
Pass it to me, Cartman!

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Hang on.
I'm going to do something super killer.

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,100
God damnit, stop it, Kyle!

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,300
All right, check it out.
This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do.

42
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,500
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole!
It's getting late!

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Let's just see who gets
the ball this time, Jewboy!

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,500
Kyle, knock it off!

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Foood!

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,200
Don't worry, it's not really manbearpig.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,900
It's me, Al Gore.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,900
We know.

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,900
Dude, what are you doing?

51
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,300
I'm spreading manbearpig awareness.

52
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,300
Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet
and a bumper sticker.

53
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>"We must all stop ManBearPig"</i>

54
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,700
I hope now you boys see
that this is totally cereal.

55
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,400
The next time,
it could be the "real" manbearpig.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet?

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,400
Just your name and phone number

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,600
and where you first heard about manbearpig?

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Uhh, Stan?
- Oh, hey Dad.

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Hello.

61
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,050
It's ah...
getting late, boys.

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,400
Why don't you get in the car
and I'll drive you all home?

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Okay, Mr. Marsh.

64
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,800
Be safe.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,100
Boys, I don't want you hanging out
with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?

66
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,300
Aw, he's all right, Dad.

67
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,400
ManBearPig?

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
He's half man and half bearpig.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,300
No, dude, he's half man
and half bear and half pig.

71
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,700
That doesn't make any sense.

72
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,400
He could be half bear, half manpig.

73
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,300
Boys, there's no such thing as a manbearpig.

74
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,100
The vice president is just
desperate for attention.

75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,100
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad.
I don't think he has any friends.

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,400
Hello?
- Hello, this is Al Gore

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
Oh man...
Hi Mr. Gore.

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,300
I was the vice president.
- I know.

79
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,000
Can you and your friends make it to an
emergency manbearpig meeting tomorrow morning?

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,300
I have some evidence
he could be in this area.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,300
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.

82
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,500
Oh. I get it.

83
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,300
You don't believe me either.

84
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,200
No, no, it's not that.
- Yes it is.

85
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,100
Nobody believes me!

86
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm trying to warn everybody
and nobody takes me cereal!

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,600
I just want somebody in the world
to take me cereal just for once.

88
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,300
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
- No, you don't.

89
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs
to be stopped. I'm just...

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,100
I'm just scared that I can't
do anything to stop him.

91
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,700
Are you cereal?

92
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,300
Yes, I'm cereal.

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Don't worry!
We can stop him!

94
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,400
Bring everyone you can to my manbearpig
meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp!

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,700
Dude, why are we going
to hang out with this guy?

96
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,900
Yeah, I don't get it.

97
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,100
Come on, you guys,
Al Gore doesn't have any friends.

98
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,600
We'll just make an appearance at
his little meeting and then we'll go.

99
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Hi kids! Come on in!

100
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay, let's get this meeting started.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
What do you kids think we
should do to stop ManBearPig?

102
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore,

103
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
uh, my dad's a geologist,

104
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,200
and he said that ManBearPig
probably isn't in Colorado.

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,900
What does your dad look like?

106
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,200
Does he have large hooves
where his feet should be?

107
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
No!

108
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,400
Damn. For a minute there,
I thought we found him.

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Well, this was a great meeting.
Wasn't it, guys?

110
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,200
But, we gotta get goin' to school now.

111
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Oh my God!

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
ManBearPig screen active!

113
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
What is this area of Colorado!
It's a it's a cave of some kind!

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,500
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds.
It's a tourist attraction.

115
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Oh Jesus on ice skates,
we've gotta get down there right away.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,300
Ah I don't think so, dude.

117
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,900
Yeah, we've got school anyway.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I can get you all excused from school.

119
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,100
You... have that kind of power?

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,200
Look!
You boys have a chance to help me find

121
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,900
and kill ManBearPig once and for all!

122
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm totally cereal!

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,800
Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds.

124
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,100
Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers

125
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,500
in one of the most elaborate
cavern systems in Colorado.

126
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,500
Before we get started I do understand
we have a special guest in our group today.

127
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,200
The ex vice-president, Mr. Al Gore.

128
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Mr. Gore asked me to make sure
you all knew he was here.

129
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Now, once we enter the cave we do
ask you that you follow two rules:

130
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,400
stay on the path and do not touch anything.

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Allright, are we ready?

132
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Yeah.

133
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,500
Let's go cavin'.

134
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,500
Here we are in the main chamber of the cave.

135
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,700
It was discovered in 1892

136
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,000
and first used as a hideout
for smugglers of the Old West.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,203
Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur

138
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:58,207
or a salmon-like odor coming
from the caves lately?

139
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
No.

140
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Now, as you can see, the cave is filled
with stalagmites and stalagtites.

141
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,600
Water drips from the cave's...
- All right, kids.

142
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I need you to keep an eye out
for manbearpig droppings.

143
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
What do manbearpig droppings look like?

144
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,000
Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.

145
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,400
These rocks often make interesting
shapes which we like to name.

146
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,700
For instance, this one here we named
"The Hanging Mushroom".

147
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,200
And over here we have
"Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls".

148
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,900
And finally, of course,
the "Two Sisters".

149
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,100
Now the cave itself is millions of years old
and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Groan! Groan!

151
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,000
Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Not yet.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,500
All right, everyone, if you'll step this way,
you'll see how the cave gets its name.

154
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,300
Kids!

155
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,700
Kids, over here!
Look.

156
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,200
What?
- I bet this is where he's hiding.

157
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,400
This looks like ManBearPig Central.

158
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Come on!

159
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,300
Come on! This is where ManBearPig is!
I'm cereal!

160
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,200
In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually
blows through, causing a sound you can hear.

161
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,500
Take a picture of the sound, Steven.

162
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,800
Mr. Gore, I I think we should
stay with the tour group.

163
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,300
Wait! Shhh.

164
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,600
Christ!
He's here!

165
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,400
Take this rope!
Be ready to tie him up!

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I've got you now, you son of a bitch!

167
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,200
What are you doing?!

168
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,700
Oh no!

169
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
No!

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,900
Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!

171
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Help!

172
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!

173
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,700
O-kay, everyone, out of the cave.
Now!

174
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,400
Hello?
- Help!

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
We're trapped in here!
- Somebody get us some help down hyah!

176
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,700
Hello, help!
- Hello?

177
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,600
Forget it!
They can't hear us!

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,900
What are we gonna do?

179
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,800
You'd better get us out of here, asshole!

180
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,500
Me?

181
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,200
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore!

182
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,700
Now we're trapped in a cave!

183
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,300
Maybe there's another way out of here.

184
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,400
Oh, no kidding.

185
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
All right, let's split up
and look for a passageway.

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,300
Everyone take a different direction.

187
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,500
Oh man, we're in big trouble here.

188
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,600
This is... bullcrap!

189
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,100
If I'ma thin I'm gonna be so... pissed off!

190
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Goddamnit!

191
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,270
You see anything, Kenny?

192
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,770
No, nothing!

193
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,770
Cartman?

194
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,770
Cartman, you see anything?

195
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,370
No, nothing...

196
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,470
No, nothing here!

197
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,870
Nothing this way!

198
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,470
Tr... treasure.

199
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,670
Cartman, you okay?

200
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,570
You need help?
- I'm fine!

201
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,070
This way is just a... dead end!
Coming back to you now!

202
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,270
It looks like we're completely sealed in.

203
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,270
Yes, I see that.

204
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,670
There's a small passageway about
200 yards over there, but...

205
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,870
it goes for a long long way
and it's pretty steep.

206
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,970
Maybe we should go for it.

207
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,370
You guys go on ahead.
I'm gonna stay here, wait it out.

208
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,270
Why?
- I just... I don't feel very good.

209
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,970
I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.

210
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,770
Cartman's right.

211
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,870
First rule of survival is stay put
and wait to be rescued.

212
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,570
No, it's okay.
You guys go on ahead.

213
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,770
No, we'll stay here too.

214
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,870
If we start wandering off,
we're gonna get lost or killed.

215
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,170
Let's just wait here
and hope help comes soon.

216
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,870
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't
go over there if I were you guys.

217
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,370
I just took a huge dump.

218
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,970
Aw, dude!

219
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,770
The cave-in was massive.

220
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,270
It has cut off all access in or out.

221
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,270
The children are believe to be
trapped somewhere in this area.

222
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,870
Does anybody know who these kids are?

223
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,470
No, nobody seems to knew them.

224
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,170
Only that they were in the tour group.

225
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,070
Digging to them is going to take days.

226
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,170
Excuse me, Excuse me.

227
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,470
This cave-in was no accident

228
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,270
and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast!

229
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,570
I am super... duper... cereal!

230
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,570
What do you mean?
The cave-in is over.

231
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,170
I'm afraid you have a much bigger
problem than a cave-in.

232
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,170
What's that?

233
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,870
What is that, a pigbearman?

234
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,370
No, stupid!
It's ManBearPig!

235
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,470
I'm sooo hungry.

236
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,170
Do you think people even know we're here?

237
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,770
They saw us on the tour.

238
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,970
Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?

239
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,570
just... n-need to keep taking a crap.

240
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,070
I got diarrhea, really bad.

241
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,170
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here
without you taking a crap every ten minutes!

242
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,870
Let's just try to sleep.
Maybe help will come tomorrow.

243
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,470
All that treasure.

244
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,770
It's all mine!

245
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,470
So long as these greedy assholes
don't find out about it!

246
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,670
You would all just looove to get your
hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?!

247
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,870
Even though I found it, you'd love
to think it's somehow yours, too!

248
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,670
God, I hate you guys!

249
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,670
Especially you...

250
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,770
you money-grubbing snake in the grass!

251
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,170
Well I have news for you, Kyle!

252
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,070
You're never going to get my treasure.

253
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,970
I've got a little plan going, to get the
treasure out of here without you ever knowing.

254
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,370
C-Cartman ?

255
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,770
Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?

256
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,370
Dude, what are you doing?

257
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,670
Not much.

258
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,070
You know, just hangin' out.

259
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,070
How've you been, man? Good?

260
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,870
Dude, get away from me!

261
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,270
Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle.
See you around.

262
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,670
Why won't anybody listen to me?!

263
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,170
ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill
him while we all have the chance.

264
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,470
I'm cereal!

265
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,870
Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down.

266
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,070
Now, what exactly do you suggest we do?

267
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,570
I told you we need to fill
the cave with hot molten lead,

268
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,570
'cause it's the only way to make
sure ManBearPig never comes out!

269
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,370
And I'm sane and I'm totally cereal,
but everyone just keeps digging!

270
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,370
Well, see, the problen is that if we
fill the caves with hot molten lead,

271
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,870
it will kill those boys too.

272
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,470
They're already dead!
Didn't you listen to me?

273
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,570
They got attacked by a manbearpig
and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive!

274
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,170
I'm super cereal!

275
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,570
Nobody will listen to me but I'm cereal!

276
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,270
Do you want me to get
the ex vice-president out of here?

277
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,170
Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him.

278
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,770
I don't think he has any friends.

279
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,070
All right. Gotta be strong.

280
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,770
There's still a lot more treasure to go.

281
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,770
Dude, he's really sick.

282
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,670
It's been three days since four unidentified
children were trapped in a cave-in.

283
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,670
Three days without food
and time is certainly running out.

284
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,670
The digging continues,
but progress is fatally slow.

285
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,070
All right, people, we've gotta work faster!

286
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,370
Our best estimate still puts us three days

287
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,970
from reaching the area of the cave
called "Smuggler's Den".

288
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,070
Smuggler's Den?

289
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,870
It's a room near the end of the tour

290
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,370
where you can get your picture
taken with fake treasure.

291
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,470
Here, see?

292
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,670
Based on where the boys were seen last,

293
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,470
they're somewhere near this area!

294
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,470
Hopefully they've followed the first
rule of survival and stayed put.

295
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,570
Stan! Stan, wake up!

296
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,570
Huh? What? Have they come for us?

297
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,070
No, it's Cartman.

298
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,470
Something's really wrong with him.

299
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,070
Oh my God.

300
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,570
Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?

301
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,570
I'm fahn.

302
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,970
Just a lit-

303
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,670
No big deal... Beh.

304
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,270
We can't wait here any longer!

305
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,270
Dude, we've gotta get him out
of here or he's gonna die.

306
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,170
How, dude?

307
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,270
We don't even know if that passage
I found goes anywhere.

308
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,270
Maybe we should get out first.

309
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,370
See if we can find a way out
and then come back for him.

310
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,770
No dont!

311
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,770
Don't leave me here, you assholes.
Don't leave me here to die.

312
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,770
Come on come on!
Pull!

313
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,370
Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!

314
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,870
Buh. Hurry you guys.
You gotta get me out of here.

315
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,770
What the hell is that?
- Cartman?

316
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,770
You guys, we've got no time!
You gotta get me out!

317
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,970
This is the end of you, ManBearPig.

318
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,370
Excelsior!

319
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,190
We're almost there!

320
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,690
I can't keep carrying him, dude!
I've got no strength!

321
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,090
Yes you do!

322
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,790
What the hell is that?

323
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,890
Oh my God.

324
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,690
No! Get me out of here!

325
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,790
Get me out of here, you guys!

326
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,590
Ruuun!

327
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,190
That's it! Pull everyone out!
There's nothing more we can do!

328
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,790
You're calling off the rescue?

329
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,990
We didn't plan on a freak river flood.

330
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,290
God must really want those kids dead.

331
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,790
Well what if the children aren't dead?

332
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,790
Look, the cavern is completely flooded.

333
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,190
Nothing could have survived.

334
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,590
There's nothing left alive down there.

335
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,990
Nothing left alive...

336
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,590
I did it.

337
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,790
I killed ManBearPig.

338
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,790
I've saved the earth from certain destruction.

339
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,490
Everyone is super-stoked on me,
even if they don't know it.

340
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,790
Kenny! Here, take my hand!

341
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,890
Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!

342
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,490
Grab my hand.

343
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,990
Cartman! You've gotta swim!

344
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,290
Kick with your legs!

345
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,990
I can't kick!
- Yes you can!

346
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,790
I can't!
Kick yourself back to safety!

347
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,890
I need your help!
- No, you just have to save me.

348
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,690
Kyle, no!

349
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,590
We are gathered here to say goodbye

350
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,490
to four kids whom we all tried to help

351
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,190
but, in the end, could not.

352
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,090
But where there is loss, there is hope.

353
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,490
For ManBearPig is no more.

354
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,590
Oh Jesus, here we go again.

355
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,790
I have beaten ManBearPig

356
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,490
and we will never forget the names
of the brave young kids who lost their lives.

357
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,190
Kid 1

358
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,990
Kid 2

359
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,790
Kid 3

360
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,790
and of course

361
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,190
Kid 4.

362
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,390
I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play.

363
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,990
And how Kid 2 was always
there when I needed him.

364
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,790
Oh my God!

365
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,790
<i>Kid 4 was filled with hope</i>

366
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,490
It's the kids!
- They're alive!

367
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,090
Kids!
I saved you!

368
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,990
Stay away from us, asshole!

369
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,490
I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you

370
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,090
because you don't have any friends!

371
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,190
But now I see why you don't have any friends!

372
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,290
You just used ManBearPig as
a way to get attention for yourself

373
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,690
because you're a LOSER!

374
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,990
Hyeah right.

375
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,290
The man who singlehandedly
killed ManBearPig is a loser.

376
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,690
We need to get our friend
to a hospital right away!

377
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,390
No!
No, I'm fine!

378
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,390
I just need to get home and rest.

379
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,590
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.

380
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,690
No! I just need to get to a toilet.

381
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,690
See you guys. I...

382
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,090
Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?

383
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,090
It's mine!
It's mine, you hear me?!

384
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,090
I got it out of the cave,
it belongs to me!

385
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,490
Keep your greedy hands away!

386
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,490
Hey, that looks like the fake treasure
from our Smuggler's Den photo room.

387
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,790
That's right
and I...

388
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,290
Fake treasure?

389
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,990
Yeah, we put it there for kids
to take their picture with.

390
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,290
All in all, I'd say that treasure
is worth about fourteen dollars.

391
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,490
No, nooo!

392
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,090
You made us pull you to safety
because you ate treasure?!

393
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,190
You son of a bitch!

394
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,890
Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?!

395
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,590
Well, my work here is done.

396
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,290
I've killed MBP

397
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,990
and now I must save
the world from something else.

398
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,490
Maybe I'll make a movie.

399
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,390
A movie starring me.

400
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,790
Then people will take me super cereal.

401
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,090
Excelsior!
