1
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:47,250
Halloween is a night for evil.
It is time for me to take what is mine.

2
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,542
What do you plan, Lord Satan?

3
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:55,500
On Halloween we shall open
the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth

4
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,167
and we will rent out the entire W Hotel

5
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:03,750
for an awesome party
and invite a bunch of celebrities!

6
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,333
How big a party are we talking?

7
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:11,833
Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage
girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties?

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,917
That big.

9
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,250
Satan, we can't possibly do-
- Silence!

10
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:21,708
Halloween is about me!
And I deserve a par-ty!

11
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:27,042
This shall be my Super Sweet 16!

12
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:32,393
Minions of Hell!

13
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:41,143
The time has come for us to rise!
For my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!

14
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:45,643
I got Bacardi and Kettle One
to sponsor the alcohol

15
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:50,685
and I'm calling it "Hell On Earth 2006"!

16
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:56,652
But now, heed my words:
in order to get in to the party

17
00:01:56,693 --> 00:02:00,610
you have to RSVP and get a blue wristband.

18
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:03,193
Everyone is gonna try
and get into this party

19
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:05,527
so if you don't get your wristband in advance

20
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:09,985
you're not wearing that wristband
at the door, you're not getting in!

21
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:17,235
And now know this: It's a costume party,
so you have to wear a costume.

22
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:23,360
But... nobody better show up as The Crow!
I'm serious.

23
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:27,235
Every costume party there's like
fourteen guys come dressed like the Crow

24
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,443
'cause they wanna look hot and hook up.

25
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:30,735
It's lame!

26
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:36,610
If you come dressed as the Crow,
you're not getting in to the party!

27
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:44,943
Go now and prepare!
If you miss my party you are a looozer!

28
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:51,985
Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth.

29
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:55,027
I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel.

30
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:58,068
This is going to be the best Halloween evah.

31
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,485
Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
- I am doing it.

32
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,902
No! Don't do it!
- What's the big deal, Kyle?

33
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:13,610
You just look in the mirror
and say the name three times.

34
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,902
Biggie Smalls...

35
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:19,735
Biggie Smalls...

36
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:20,943
See? You're scared.

37
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:25,277
Because you know if you say it a third time,
he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face.

38
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,110
Fine!
Then you do it, you're so tough!

39
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:29,777
I've done it lots of times.
- Prove it!

40
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:35,777
Biggie Smalls...

41
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:39,027
Biggie Smalls...

42
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:42,068
This is dumb, you guys,
let's do somethin' else.

43
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,985
You're afraid to do it, too.
- I am not!

44
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:46,527
Then do it, if you're not yellow!

45
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:51,485
Biggie Smalls...

46
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:54,235
Biggie Smalls...

47
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,652
Biggie...
- Hey fellas.

48
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:01,735
You should come downstairs.
Stan's mom made pa-pizza.

49
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:04,235
Let's go.
Yeah, let's go!

50
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,443
Oh my God. I crapped my pants.

51
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:09,735
You guys, I crapped my pants!

52
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:11,777
You guys! You guys, check it out!

53
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:20,985
Satan, I must speak with thee.
- What is it?

54
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,318
You've invited so many celebrities
on Earth to your party

55
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:27,943
that people in Hell can't get wristbands.

56
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:31,360
Well I have to invite celebrities
or else my party won't be cool.

57
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:39,068
Satan, I warn thee, do not thorw this party
at the cost of alienating your friends.

58
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:42,568
I'm not alienating my friends!
I know they come first!

59
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,902
I hope for your sake that's true.

60
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:48,652
You've never thrown a party of
this magnitude before, Satan.

61
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:50,402
Be wary.

62
00:04:56,402 --> 00:05:00,152
Halloween has always been
a time of evil and darkness.

63
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:03,652
But now it appears that Satan
will literally be among us.

64
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:08,027
He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles
and from what we understand.

65
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:12,652
The gathering is going to be...
completely off the hook.

66
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:20,360
There's more:
None of us... are invited.

67
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:24,527
None?
- Satan mocks us.

68
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,527
His party must be stopped.

69
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:30,360
Yes,  we cannot let evil take
over our city, even for a night.

70
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:32,443
What can we do?

71
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:37,068
Tomorrow night, after all
of Satan's guests have arrived

72
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:40,110
we'll call in a complaint about
how many people are there.

73
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:46,527
We'll see how long Satan's party lasts...
after the fire marshal shows up.

74
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:53,652
<i>That's why I like to brush my teeth.
I know they're clean and white.</i>

75
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:58,902
All the-
I truly love to brush my teeth.

76
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:06,985
Biggie Smalls...

77
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,902
Biggie Smalls...

78
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:12,860
Biggie Smalls...

79
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:16,277
What the fuck is this?!

80
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:26,652
Butters! We told you to be in bed!
What are you doing?!

81
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:29,902
I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!

82
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:33,527
You had a nightmare! Turn around
and get back in your room right now!

83
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:36,235
But Dad, his gonna bust a cap in my ass!

84
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,318
Well, you wanna get shot
or you wanna be grounded?!

85
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,152
Honestly, why do let him watch
that darn Black Entertainment Channel?

86
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:50,402
So I want the DJ to set up over here

87
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:53,610
and then the main dance floor area
can be this whole area right here.

88
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:56,860
What about valets?
How will people be arriving from Hell?

89
00:06:56,943 --> 00:07:00,610
Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy,
they they won't have cars.

90
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:03,985
But we're probably gonna want security
at the dimensional vortex gate.

91
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:07,735
I want all the servers dressed in skimpy
outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres.

92
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:11,735
This is getting really expensive.
- Shut up, it's Halloween!

93
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,443
This is my night!

94
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:16,568
Then at midnight, for dessert,
I'm thinking over here

95
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:19,735
we bring out a huuuge
chocolate fondue fountain.

96
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:23,818
Oh yeah, P. Diddy had his birthday party here
a couple years back and he had one of those.

97
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,360
Oh, screw that, then. I don't want
a fondue fountain if P. Diddy had one.

98
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,693
Does it matter?!
- Yes it matters!

99
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:31,402
I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it!

100
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:33,902
How about a doughnut machine?
- Did Diddy do it?

101
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:34,860
Diddy did do it.

102
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:36,985
A full ice cream bar!
- Diddy did it.

103
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:39,277
Damnit, what didn't Diddy do?!

104
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:42,527
Wait. I know.

105
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:48,110
Yes. It's perfect.
At midnight, all the lights go down.

106
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:54,360
The music stops.
And then we wheel in... a Ferrari.

107
00:07:54,527 --> 00:08:01,818
Only it isn't a Ferrari... It's a cake.
And everyone gets a piece.

108
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:05,235
A Ferrari cake?
- Diddy didn't do it.

109
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,360
Satan, really, the logistics of getting
a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time-

110
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,735
This party has to be the bomb
Don't you get it?!

111
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:19,985
When everyone sees the Ferrari cake,
they will shudder and know my greatness!

112
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:27,818
Hear me, demons!
Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake!

113
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:35,027
Now I will take charge of Halloween and call
upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls!

114
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,860
Ted Bundy!

115
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,610
Jeffrey Dahmer!

116
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,693
And John Wayne Gacy!

117
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:53,277
You  shall rise once again to walk the earth,
for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you...

118
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:58,568
to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake
and deliver it to the W Hotel!

119
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:01,068
No problem.
- We can handle it.

120
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:07,193
Heed my words: Satan's entire
Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake.

121
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:12,652
Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!

122
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,318
You punkass fool!

123
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:25,610
Why'd you summon me?
- P-please don't ice me, homie.

124
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:30,485
You'd better have a good reason, sucka!
- I just... w-was seein' if it works.

125
00:09:30,818 --> 00:09:34,110
Damn!  Every Halloween
I gots tuh deal with this shit!

126
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:37,485
I'm in hell, mindin' my own business
and the next thing I know

127
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:39,443
I'm in some kid's bathroom.

128
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:41,777
I apologize, Mr. Smalls.

129
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:44,568
You don't understand, fool!
I ain't missin' the party!

130
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:47,568
W-what party?
- I already got my wristband, see?

131
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,693
You've got to get me to Los Angeles!

132
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:51,568
Well can't you just take a plane?

133
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:54,068
How, punk?!
We don't use money in her, nigga!

134
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:56,235
Well damn, nigga, there's gotta be some way!

135
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:57,860
This is your fault, homie!

136
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,443
You've gots to get me to that party in L.A.
or i'm gonna smoke your ass!

137
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:03,443
Oh hamburgehers!

138
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:14,852
Yes. Yes, Satan.
Your Halloween costume turned out perfect.

139
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:20,893
Yeah, it's okay, but everyone thinks
Zazul's schoolgirl costume is hotter.

140
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,518
Zazul, switch costumes with me.

141
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,310
Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume.

142
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:31,560
Nobody can look hotter than me!
It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!

143
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:33,893
Take it off, Zazul.

144
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,685
And what about my Ferrari cake?!
Where's the Ferrari cake?!

145
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,810
Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery.

146
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,162
All right, this is the place.

147
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:59,620
Now remember, you numbskulls

148
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,578
this Ferrari cake is really important
for Satan's party, so don't louse it up!

149
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:07,037
Who's lousing?
- Come here. Shut up!

150
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:11,662
Can I help you?
- We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake.

151
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,995
Oh yes, it's just about finished.
What kind of truck are we loading it up to?

152
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:16,203
We got that flatbed.

153
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:18,995
Okay well, we're just gonna need to-

154
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,495
Gacy, you numbskull, what'd ya kill him for?!

155
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:24,953
I didn't mean tuh.
- Give me that!

156
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:26,787
What's the matter with you?!
Take this!

157
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:29,453
Everything all right?

158
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:31,578
You nincompoop!
That was the baker!

159
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,828
He startled me.

160
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,537
Gacy!

161
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,078
What'dja kill him for?!
Sit down!

162
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:41,203
I'm a victim of circumstance.
- Ahh, who're you hittin'?

163
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,287
Get outta here. Be quiet.

164
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:49,787
You idiots! Now who's gonna help us
load the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed?!

165
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:55,495
Did your son say anything
before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?

166
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:59,203
He just said something about...
summoning Biggie Smalls.

167
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:01,745
Dude.

168
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,662
Du... du... dude.

169
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,037
Dad! Dad!
- What?

170
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,162
If you look in the mirror
and say Biggie Smalls' name three times

171
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,078
he doesn't come and get you, right?

172
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,453
Biggie Smalls?

173
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:19,120
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen,
sippin' on booze at the House of Blues.

174
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:23,037
All right, boys, I know it's Halloween,
but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.

175
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:26,120
How do you know?
- I'm a geologist!

176
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,328
He's right. It's just a spook story.

177
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:31,037
Then how come you couldn't do it?

178
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,995
I can do it. It just got... look,
it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.

179
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:38,370
How can we be sure? How do we know
Butters isn't with Biggie right now?

180
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,203
Being tormented by him?

181
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:46,287
<i>I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali.</i>

182
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:50,537
<i>Yeah, I'm going going,
back back, to Cali Cali.</i>

183
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,328
Yo dawg, keep it down.

184
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,412
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right
after the flight so I don't get grounded?

185
00:12:56,495 --> 00:13:00,662
Oh no! You summoned my spirit,
you're gettin' me all the way to the party!

186
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:05,120
As long as I get to the party in time
to party, everything'll be all right.

187
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,120
Hey!
- ...Smalls.

188
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,370
Oh, God-damnit!

189
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:13,245
It does work!
- Holly crap!

190
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:16,078
That's it!
Now I'm pissed!

191
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:36,912
Hehey, everybody.
Check out Hitler.

192
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:39,620
He's the "Can you hear me now?" guy.

193
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,745
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

194
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:46,912
Everyone quiet!

195
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:51,453
Here he is, the man of the night, Satan!

196
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:58,912
Get out of the way, Hitler!
You're ruining my entrance!

197
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:02,620
Yes, hello?
It this the fire department?

198
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:08,745
I need to make a complaint to the fire marshal.

199
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,995
He's what? Where?

200
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,620
Damn your evil heart, Satan!

201
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:18,578
What?
- Fire marshal is at the party!

202
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:22,662
Satan invited him!
Satan's trickery knows no bounds!

203
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:27,203
That's it! One way or another,
we're crashing this party!

204
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,495
This is VIP. Don't just let
anybody into my VIP area, okay?

205
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,787
Hey, Satan, you got a little problem.
- What?

206
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:40,495
Somebody showed up in
a Crocodile Hunter costume.

207
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,620
It's really offending some of the other guests.

208
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:44,662
Oh jeez.

209
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:52,995
Hey,  uh, hi, listen, dude, ya know,
the whole Crocodile Hunter thing?

210
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:54,828
It... it's just a little soon, you know?

211
00:14:54,828 --> 00:15:00,037
I mean, he just dies a few weeks ago
and it's just not supercool and you gotta leave.

212
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,287
But it's me, Satan. Steve Irwin.
I am the Crocodile Hunter.

213
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,870
Oh, but then, dude, no costume.
Sorry, you gotta go.

214
00:15:09,912 --> 00:15:12,245
Wait! I thought we were friends!

215
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,787
Oh hey, Sinatra!

216
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:19,203
Demonius!
Demonius, we have a problem!

217
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:22,620
What is it?
- The Ferrari cake! It isn't here!

218
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,828
What? Don't even tell me that!

219
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,953
It was never delivered to the hotel.

220
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,287
Sevo! Fetch my Blackberry!
That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight!

221
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:49,453
Do you gentlemen need a hand?

222
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,162
Gacy!

223
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,912
Whatcha do that foor?!

224
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:59,412
I did it for Dahmer.
- For Dahmer?

225
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:03,203
Yeah. He likes havin' sex with dead bodies.

226
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:06,412
Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!

227
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:09,453
What good are intestines
if you can't have sex with them?

228
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:12,828
We gotta get rid of this body
before anyone sees it!

229
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:18,037
Now get those to the trashcan!

230
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,120
Stop eating that!

231
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,495
Leave him alone!

232
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:24,537
Cut it!
Come here ya.

233
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:28,662
There.

234
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,870
The cake!

235
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:39,953
Oh, no!

236
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:41,870
Mmm, Ferrari.

237
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,703
What's the matter with you?!
It's ruined!

238
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,412
We're gonna get it now.

239
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,870
This is a really extravagant party, Satan.

240
00:16:56,953 --> 00:16:59,537
I know, but just wait till midnight.

241
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,703
You are not gonna believe
what's coming for desert!

242
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:09,953
These aren't the right wristbands.
- Yes, they are.

243
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:12,703
Then how come they say "Knott's Berry Farm"?

244
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:15,203
In the name of Christ, just let us in!

245
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:19,947
We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.

246
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,405
Not as sorry as you're gonna be,
if I completely miss the party!

247
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:26,655
Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles
boarding in 10 minutes.

248
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:29,072
See? You can still make it
for the end of the party.

249
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:30,738
Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss-

250
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:33,655
What the? No! No!

251
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,322
...Smalls.

252
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,863
No way!

253
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:39,322
Motherfuckiing God-damnit!

254
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,697
That's pretty cool.
Hey, Hey Sharon!

255
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,405
Cool this, sucka!

256
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:53,288
All right, listen you mugs!
It's now 11:30.

257
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,372
That means we only have twenty minutes
to bake a new Ferrari cake.

258
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:59,830
No problem! It just so happens that
I went to an Italian cooking school.

259
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,330
Yeah? Why'd you quit?
- There weren't enough Italians to eat.

260
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,747
Get over here!

261
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:11,538
All right, what's the recipe call for first?
- Ten thousand eggs.

262
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,330
Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs.
- You get 'em!

263
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:16,372
Shut up!

264
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:18,997
Oh! Oh, wise guy, ey?

265
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:23,372
How's  that?
- Hey! Leave him alone!

266
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:27,205
Try that again!

267
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:31,455
What happened?
- Shut up!

268
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:42,372
He can't do it, he can't do it.
- All right, be quiet.

269
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:47,163
Biggie Smalls.

270
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:49,830
Biggie Smalls.

271
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:52,580
Oh I can't do it!
I'm too freaked out.

272
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:57,663
What do we do? It's midnight.
The Ferrari cake never arrived!

273
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,538
This is terrible!

274
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,455
It's okay! It's okay!
I found a backup!

275
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:06,705
Go ahead and start the ceremony!

276
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:11,205
Your attention please.

277
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:16,955
It is now midnight!
Time for Satan's special surprise.

278
00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:20,372
I wonder what this is going to be.

279
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:22,955
Just you wait.

280
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:31,122
Yes . Here it comes.

281
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:37,205
Ladies and gentlemen:
a fully edible Acura cake!

282
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,997
Acura?

283
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:44,913
But I wanted a Ferrari!

284
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:47,163
We did the best we could,
there was a problem.

285
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,247
Acuras are really nice.

286
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,163
It's not the car I wanted!
The whole party is ruined!

287
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:57,413
It doesn't matter. Your guests
are having fun. They don't care.

288
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:02,580
It's not about them, it's all about meee!

289
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:10,247
Wow, what a jerk.

290
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:16,080
Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell.
I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake.

291
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,288
Oh God, what's happened to me.

292
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:23,580
I've never been this terrible before.

293
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:28,955
By trying to have a party like those
spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV.

294
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:31,205
I've become like one of them.

295
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,372
Satan, don't be so hard on yourself.
You're not as bad as they are.

296
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:35,705
But I am.

297
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:40,622
Throwing people out, making a big entrance,
having these stupid pictures of me all over.

298
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,247
Halloween is supposed to be for everyone.

299
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:46,872
Everybody, I'm sorry.
This party is for you.

300
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,497
It's for all of you who make my life so special.

301
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:57,080
If I don't realize that, then I'm no better
than a rich American teenage girl.

302
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:05,163
Open the doors! Let everyone in,
wristband or no!

303
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,788
Excuse me.
