1
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:38,712
The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman

2
00:00:38,712 --> 00:00:41,730
cannot wait for the new
Nintendo Wii to come out.

3
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,253
Unable to cope with the wait any longer,

4
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,986
Eric decides to freeze
himself for three weeks.

5
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:50,563
But a freak avalanche makes
Eric impossible to find,

6
00:00:50,563 --> 00:00:56,410
and so he remains frozen for 500 years.

7
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:54,760
Whoa, steady!

8
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,997
This way, otters!

9
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,679
This is it. New New Hampshire.

10
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:05,947
We have risked much bringing
you here, Time Child.

11
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,491
Can it. You otters may have
evolved to the point you can talk,

12
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,229
but I don't need lectures.

13
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,265
Don't let the time
child out of your sight.

14
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:16,593
He could try to run.

15
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:18,183
We have a deal, Blavius.

16
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,317
As long as I get what I want,

17
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:20,945
you have nothin' to worry abuot.

18
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:25,977
Something is spooking the ostriches.

19
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,283
Sure. This is Monarch land now.

20
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,480
Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.

21
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,142
Here it is! We have arrived.

22
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:33,047
Hold!

23
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:34,706
This is it, Time Child.

24
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:38,297
The old museum of technology,
abandoned long ago.

25
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,451
Let's get what you want, Time
Child, and get out of here.

26
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,207
Over here!

27
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:54,155
Yeah it's here! It's
here! The Nintendo Wii...

28
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,423
I've waited so long for this.

29
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,958
All right, Time Child, we've
filled our side of the bargain.

30
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,635
Now return with us to Otter Bay.

31
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:05,788
Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans.

32
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:08,991
NOOOO!

33
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:10,149
It was a trick!

34
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,146
SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!

35
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,015
I got it! I got the Wii!

36
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:20,205
Time Child! You've returned!

37
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:23,043
We thought for sure you had
died in the in the Phobart plant.

38
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:25,770
Yeah. Lucky for me the otters
believed I was on their side.

39
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:29,155
Do me a favor: next time
I'm in a recessed biocave,

40
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:30,984
don't send me a level 2 homing call.

41
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,580
TC, wait!

42
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,565
Oh I can't wait! This
is gonna be so awesome!

43
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:39,223
Get out of my way!

44
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:41,158
You gained the otters' trust?!

45
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:43,568
Were you wearing an
information crystal?!

46
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:44,759
Here.

47
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,129
Science be praised.
This could end the war!

48
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,934
You've done a great thing, TC.

49
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:51,613
How can we repay you?

50
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,541
Just send a maintenance guy to my room.

51
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,669
I want this Nintendo hooked
up to my float screen NOW!

52
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:00,859
Come on! Come on!

53
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:03,131
Dude, what is taling
so long! I wanna play!

54
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,594
Uhh, what kind of output does this have?

55
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:09,288
This is some ancient
Super-VHS output or somethin'.

56
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:11,208
I can't connect it to your flaot screen.

57
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,735
There's gotta be some way to hook it up!

58
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:15,282
It's the freakin' future!

59
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:16,846
It may be the future for you,

60
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:21,243
but I can't hook up anything to a float
screen without at least a laser-7 output.

61
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:24,421
You've gotta be shittin'
me!! Science-damnit!

62
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:26,725
I am so fucking sick of the future!

63
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,770
TC? What's wrong?

64
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,021
I'll tell you what's wrong!

65
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:33,394
I've been waiting 500 years
to play the Nintendo Wii!

66
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:36,339
And if I don't get to play
real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!

67
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,056
Well, we're all glad you're back.

68
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:40,400
I know somebody who's
missed you very much.

69
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,524
Come on in, K-10.

70
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,189
Bark bark. Hello,
Eric. I have missed you.

71
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,703
Suck my balls, K-10.
I'm not in the mood.

72
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:53,536
Fellow atheists: the
time child has returned

73
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:58,490
with information on our sworn
enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance.

74
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,871
They have started digging
for clams in sector J7.

75
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:06,478
If we mount an all-out attack,
we can wipe out their food supply!

76
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,945
But, those are civilian otters.

77
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:12,247
We cannot tolerate the otters!
Their Science is flawed!

78
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:15,457
Their answer to the Great
Question is different from ours.

79
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:18,775
Yes, but... sending out all
our ships at the same time..

80
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,770
it would leave our city exposed!

81
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:25,961
...That's why we have to be super-duper
sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.

82
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:32,569
The United Atheist Alliance is about
to send out all its defense ships

83
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,519
to take down the Allied
Atheist Allieance's clam fields.

84
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,777
Praise Science

85
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:40,244
This is your chance, young Shvek,
to avenge your father's death.

86
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:41,460
Careful, son.

87
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,285
Just because their Science
leads them to a different answer

88
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:47,592
to the Great Question doesn't mean
we have the right to kill them all.

89
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:51,683
No! Our answer to the Great
Question is the only logical one.

90
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,354
Our Science is great.

91
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,942
Let us not forget the
great Richard Dawkins

92
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:58,531
who finally freed the
world of religion long ago.

93
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:01,633
Dawkins knew that logic and
reason were the way of the future.

94
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:04,542
But it wasn't until he
met his beautiful wife

95
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:08,226
that he learned using logic
and reason isn't enough.

96
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:11,965
You have to be a dick to everyone
who doesn't think like you.

97
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,315
Prepare all the troops!

98
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:18,871
We will level the United
Atheist Alliance to the ground!

99
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:22,165
With new Glade monvert cleaner,

100
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:25,355
you can make your monvert
sparkle like never before.

101
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:27,920
My monvert's never looked so clean.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,891
God I hate future TV.
There's too many commercials!

103
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,201
Agh! I'm so bored.

104
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,600
There's nothing to do.

105
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,954
Tell me about it.

106
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:40,063
Hey, I know! Let's crank
call people in the past!

107
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:40,820
Huh?

108
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,686
I just got...

109
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:43,710
the Crank Prank Time Phone!

110
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,027
New, from Blasbro, it's
Crank Prank Time Phone!

111
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:52,142
I just dial a random
number on the keypad,

112
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:55,307
enter a date and year on
the debilibrator, and...

113
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:58,415
Wow! Someone from the
past is on the line!

114
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:01,250
Hello? Is there a refrigierator running?

115
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,090
Well then, you'd better go catch it!

116
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:08,078
What ?

117
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:11,190
Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right?

118
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,158
Could I speak to Al Coholic, please?

119
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:17,362
Crank Prank Time Phone
comes with debilibrator

120
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:21,271
antimatter fusion cone, and
30 plain HF watt triggers.

121
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:32,608
Why didn't anyone tell me
there was a time phone?!

122
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:34,367
Why does it matter? Bark bark

123
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,543
Don't you see?? If I
get one of those phones,

124
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:40,027
I can call myself in the past
and tell me not to freeze myself.

125
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:44,744
Then I can go back into my
time... and play Nintendo Wii.

126
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:47,728
Bark bark. That call is
for crank calling only.

127
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,202
Using it in the way
you describe is illegal.

128
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:52,785
I care! Where's the closest toy store??

129
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:56,122
Working, bark bark. The
Jarvanian shopping comples.

130
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,269
But it is not open yet.

131
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,870
Come on! Come on!

132
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,810
Store is now... open.

133
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,643
Welcome

134
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:09,510
Ugh, finally!

135
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,167
Welcome to Zeebod's Toys

136
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,835
I want one of those time-phone things.

137
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:15,400
Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure.

138
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,563
Now, I am required by
the state to make sure

139
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,688
you know this is for
prank-calling the past ONLY, right?

140
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:22,618
Yeah yeah, I'm only
gonna prank-call people.

141
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:25,125
All right, that'll be 6000 credits.

142
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,401
Six thousand credits?! What do I
look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!

143
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:32,366
This is a pretty advanced piece
of equipment. It's expensive.

144
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,989
Look, I have to have
one of those phones!

145
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:39,550
Oh, all right, then I
have to have 6000 credits.

146
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:43,558
Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark.

147
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:46,057
How about a robot?
How much for the robot?

148
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:47,402
Awww.

149
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:51,067
Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have
to crank-call people in the present.

150
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:56,758
Science-damnit! Wait. K-10, can you
access the store's sales records?

151
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:59,482
Working, bark bark. Access.

152
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:01,078
I want the name and address of anybody

153
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:03,303
who's bought a time phone
from this guy in the past week.

154
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:05,133
Working, bark bark.

155
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:10,573
The United Atheist
Alliance has taken the bait!

156
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:15,131
Soon they will send their ships out
to destroy our decoy clam fields!

157
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:19,127
And while their ships are away, the United
Atheist League intends to attack them!

158
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:21,133
Our plan has worked perfectly!

159
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:24,697
For when the United Atheist League
attacks the United Atheist Alliance,

160
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,153
we will charge in and kill them all!

161
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:30,332
Our Science, our answer to the
Great Question shall prevail!

162
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:34,504
Hail Science! Hail
Science! Hail Science!

163
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:37,701
And I will personally
kill the Time Child,

164
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:41,404
and eat his entrails on my tummy!

165
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,073
I'll get it, darling.

166
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:55,038
Hello? Hello?

167
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:58,529
Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall?

168
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,763
I'm sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.

169
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:02,690
Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there?

170
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,639
Nno, there are no Walls here.

171
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,471
Then how does your roof stay up?

172
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,988
Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson
boys from down the street?!

173
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:12,707
No, we're from the future.

174
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:13,716
Very funny!

175
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:17,000
Hi, uh, I'm a Pepper, and I'm wondering
if you'd like to be a Pepper too?

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,685
God darn ya!

177
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,735
Yeah.

178
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:22,088
That was a great one!

179
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:28,049
Hello, I'm with the
cubic waste department.

180
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:30,210
I need to check your
lowertram for inhibitors.

181
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:33,200
Oh. Okay, I guess.

182
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,516
Come on in, Bob.

183
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:39,128
All right, just let me use my tools...

184
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:41,968
Hey!

185
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:45,624
Haha! Stupid assholes!
I got your time phone!

186
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,523
Science H. Logic! What a jerk!

187
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:01,093
Silence, otters!

188
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,526
It's the Wise One

189
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:05,735
The Wise One speaks.

190
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,087
This is not the path
we should be taking.

191
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,959
Will more bloodshed end anything?

192
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:18,124
Wise One, our answer to the Great Question
is the only one based on good science.

193
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:22,867
Science, reason, is
that really all there is?

194
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,993
They are not a logical race, Wise One!

195
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:27,571
They go around chopping
down trees for tables,

196
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,009
when they have perfectly
good tummies to eat on.

197
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,504
How logical is that?!

198
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:35,340
Yes! The great Dawkins said we cannot
tolerate those who don't use reason!

199
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,770
How reasonable is it to eat
off wood instead of your tummy?

200
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,558
Well perhaps the great
Dawkins wasn't so wise.

201
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:46,407
Oh, he was intelligent, but, some
of the most intelligent otters

202
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:50,158
I've ever known were completely
lacking in common sense.

203
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:54,602
Maybe, some otters do need
to believe in something.

204
00:11:54,602 --> 00:12:00,198
Who knows? Maybe, just
believing in God makes God exist.

205
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,941
Kill the Wise One!

206
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,637
Whoa, wait wait!

207
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:21,213
Oh God!

208
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,864
Hello?

209
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:30,712
Hello?

210
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:33,433
Are you there?

211
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,664
Who is this?

212
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:35,949
No, no, I have me.

213
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:38,380
All right, all right, listen!
Listen to me carefully!

214
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,279
You need to be patient!

215
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,345
What?? Who the hell is this?!

216
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,267
It's me.

217
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,991
- Me who?!
- Me you!

218
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:46,948
What?!

219
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:48,281
I'm you in the future!

220
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,836
You have to be patient and wait
for the Nintendo Wii to come out,

221
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,830
or else you'll wake up in the future and
have to deal with a bunch of see otters!

222
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,189
Oh very funny, Kyle!

223
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,815
It's not Kyle, it's you!

224
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:58,792
Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.

225
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,924
I'm trying to do you a favor,
dumbass!! Just listen to me!

226
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:03,302
Listen to this!

227
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:06,014
Dickhead.

228
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:13,225
What an asshole!

229
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:17,755
Hello?

230
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:20,431
Butters? Butters!

231
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,466
Eric? Iiis that you?

232
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:24,889
Butters, Butters! Listen
to me! Just just listen.

233
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,185
I'm about to come over to your house
and ask you to help me freeze myself.

234
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:30,233
Do not... do it!

235
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:33,488
Eric, are you playing
a joke on me again?

236
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,040
No! This is not a joke!

237
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,206
Whatever I say to you, Butters,

238
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:40,276
no matter how hard I try, do
not... do... what I tell you!

239
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:41,578
But...

240
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:43,692
but you're here right now.

241
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:46,576
Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!

242
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,362
No! Don't listen to me!
Tell me to go screw myself!

243
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,040
Huh??

244
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,857
Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!

245
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:55,001
But, you're telling
me not to go with you.

246
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,110
What??

247
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,656
Who the fuck is this?!

248
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,231
Aw damnit, just listen to me!

249
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:02,427
If you freeze yourself,
you're going to die!

250
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:03,570
Suck my balls!

251
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,100
No, you suck my balls!! Just
listen to me for one minute!

252
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,035
...Okay, you have one minute.

253
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:10,441
Right before you left
for Butters' house,

254
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:15,370
you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde
Frog so nothing would happen to him, right?

255
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,889
Are you spying on me?!

256
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,976
No, I am you, you stupid asshole!

257
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:21,282
Fuck you, asshole. You
can go fuck yourself!

258
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:23,115
Come on, Butters, we're going!

259
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,337
Oh, all right then.

260
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:27,869
God I hate that guy!!

261
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:30,415
My friends, the time has come!

262
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:33,866
May Science give us the
courage to do what we must!

263
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,824
Launch all defensive ships to sector J7!

264
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:39,463
Take out the otters' clam fields!

265
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:46,551
Sir! The United Atheist Alliance
has sent out all their ships.

266
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,061
Their capital is now unprotected.

267
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:54,071
Then begin the attack!
Science be praised.

268
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:07,079
Kill the table-eaters! In
the name of Almighty Science!

269
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:16,359
Hello?

270
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,378
Hello? Kyle?

271
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:19,373
Hello?

272
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:22,924
Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's
Eric. Uh, how's it going?

273
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:24,604
What do you want?!

274
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:26,837
Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know,

275
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:29,357
so I think maybe you're the only
person who can understand this.

276
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:32,049
You know how earlier today I
asked you to help me freeze myself?

277
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,356
I'm not going to help you freeze
yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!

278
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,380
No, see, I know it's a stupid idea.

279
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,756
Because, I actually
did freeze myself.and...

280
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:44,295
you were right, Kyle. It it backfired
and I was frozen for 500 years,

281
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:46,665
and now I'm calling you from the future.

282
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,699
.. Uh huh.

283
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,591
No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously.

284
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:53,206
Here, talk to my robot dog.

285
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:56,473
Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark.

286
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,906
.. I'm hanging up now.

287
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:03,755
No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right
about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.

288
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,911
Suck my balls, fatass.

289
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,468
.. I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle.

290
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,154
Just stop me from freezing myself,

291
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:13,814
and I will get down on my knees,
and I will suck your balls.

292
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:15,824
I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle.

293
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:19,682
Aw Goddamnit, now you've
made me miss my ride!

294
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:21,770
My whole day is screwed
up because of you!

295
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:25,312
Kyle? Kyle?

296
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,484
Eric, I really think you
should stop calling the past.

297
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:29,941
You could change the present.

298
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:32,637
Well I don't notice anything
different, KIT-9! Do you?

299
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:35,772
I guess not, meow meow.

300
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:40,029
Hm, I see... Hey!

301
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:41,366
Meow meow.

302
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,046
- Heeeeey!
- Meow meow.

303
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,621
- Heeeeey!
- Meow meow.

304
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,190
TC! We're under attack!

305
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,060
By who?!

306
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,700
We have to get to the War
Room! It's the only safe place!

307
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:06,127
The United Atheist League is
bombing the city! We're defenseless!

308
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:10,698
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the
future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!

309
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:13,264
Sir! The sea otters are advancing!

310
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,097
They've broken through the east portal!

311
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,500
What?! Three-way
phone channel onscreen!

312
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,754
What are you otters
doing?! This is our attack!

313
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,146
Yes. And we're attacking both of you!

314
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,667
You fools! This will
be the end of us all!

315
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:35,292
Then accept our answer to the Great
Question, and we will withdraw.

316
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:38,430
Your answer to the Great
Question is illogical!

317
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,006
What is the Great Question?

318
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:42,676
What atheists should call themselves.

319
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:46,764
Unified Atheist League
is the most logical name.

320
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:49,901
Unified Atheist Allianace
makes more sense.

321
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:53,693
No! Allied Atheist Alliance!
That way it has three A's!

322
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,597
That is the logical choice!

323
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:59,954
So be it. We cannot
agree; prepare to die.

324
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,035
Forward missiles launched, sir!

325
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,621
I have to get out of here!

326
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:06,623
Why is everyone in my past so stupid
that they think I'm crank-calling them?!

327
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:10,729
But Eric, meow meow, you knew the
wife of the smartest man in history.

328
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:11,772
Who?

329
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:14,189
Your teacher, the one called Garrison.

330
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:16,690
Garrison? But he's an asshole.

331
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,769
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey!
Give this monkey what she wants!

332
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,585
Oh Ms. Garrison!

333
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:30,089
Damnit, who the hell is calling?!

334
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,610
I'll thell them... to call
you back... Oh... yeah...

335
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,794
Garrison residence. Can you
call... back later, please?

336
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:40,128
It's an emergency! It's an emergency!

337
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:41,327
An emergency?

338
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,758
I need to speak to
Mr. Garrison right now!

339
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:46,788
I'm sorry, but Mr.
Garrison has passed away.

340
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:51,204
Mrs. Garrison is the only person here
and she's rather tied up at the moment.

341
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,400
Look asshole, this is a real emergency!

342
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,660
Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison
wants to call himself since
the sex-change operation!

343
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,001
Sex-change operation??

344
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:01,986
Uh oh.

345
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,638
Uuuuugh! You're a man?!

346
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:07,433
Not anymore. I've been fixed.

347
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,769
Richard, hold on. I can explain.

348
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:13,403
Explain?? How can I be so stupid??

349
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:16,546
Richard, come back, please!

350
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,570
Well go ahead and leave,
you atheist faggot!

351
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,685
Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!

352
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:28,079
Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison!

353
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:35,735
All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?

354
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:39,872
Go... Right... Where am I going?

355
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:41,931
W-we told you: we're sending you home.

356
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,147
With the Crank and Wank Time Machine.

357
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,526
Don't worry, my son.

358
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:48,293
When you return to your time you
will merge with your other self.

359
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:49,978
It's all very Zen.

360
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:54,003
Wait... Isn't... everybody
at war over atheism?

361
00:19:54,003 --> 00:19:58,670
Atheism? No. We've learned to get
rid of all the isms in our time.

362
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,121
Yes. Long ago we realized isms are
great for those who are rational,

363
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:07,831
but in the hands of irrational
people, isms always lead to violence.

364
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,481
So there is no war now in the future.

365
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:14,640
Of course there's war. The stupid French
-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.

366
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,675
Yeah!

367
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,335
But now the moment has come
to send you back to your time.

368
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:24,964
We unfroze you for a purpose,
and now that purpose is fulfilled.

369
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:26,346
And what was that purpose again?

370
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:28,746
We explained that to you already.

371
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:29,674
Right...

372
00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:32,766
Goodbye, Eric. I will
mess you. Squawk squawk

373
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,714
I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.

374
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:37,940
So long, Eric. And tell
everyone in the past for us,

375
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,564
that no one single
answer... is ever the answer.

376
00:20:45,764 --> 00:20:46,800
Noooo!

377
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm back. Wow! I'm back!

378
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,075
There you are, Eric.

379
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:55,187
Mom! Mom, they did it!

380
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,900
Eric, you have to come home.

381
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,121
You can't just wait here
for that game to come out.

382
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:03,276
No, I know. You're right, Mom.
I need to learn to be patient.

383
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:06,433
I think I can wait three weeks
for Nintendo Wii to come out.

384
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,198
But, honey, it's only September. That...

385
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:11,726
Nintendo Wii doesn't
come out for two months.

386
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:17,265
What? NO! NO !!!!!

387
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:20,435
You sent me back too
far!! HEY! Do it over!

388
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:21,872
Who are you talking to, muffin?

389
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:23,398
I can't wait two months!

390
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:25,904
I can't! There has to
be a way around this!

391
00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:29,006
Hey, kid, somebody's
on the phone for you.

392
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,640
Hello?

393
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,397
Hello? Hello? I know
what you're thinking!

394
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,003
Do not do it!

395
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:39,723
You just need to be patient
and wait the two months!

396
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:40,874
Do you hear me?!

397
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,686
Oh, suck my balls, Kyle!
