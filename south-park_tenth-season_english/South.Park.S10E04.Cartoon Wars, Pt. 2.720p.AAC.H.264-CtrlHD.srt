1
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:41,642
<i>The popular cartoon, Family Guy, is going
to show the image of Muhammad uncensored!</i>

2
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,902
If we all bury our heads in sand

3
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,073
we can avoid being any part of this.

4
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,827
I'm gonna do whatever I can. To get that
episode pulled before this gets out of hand.

5
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:52,013
You just want Family Guy off the air...

6
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:54,665
Kyle, stop it!

7
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,999
So long, Kyle!

8
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,409
You son of a bitch!
I won't let you win!

9
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:03,751
Mr. President, there's something about the
Family Guy writing staff I think you should know.

10
00:01:04,193 --> 00:01:08,723
<i>And now, the thrilling conclusion of...
Cartoon Wars.</i>

11
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:10,279
<i>Will not be seen tonight!</i>

12
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:14,066
<i>So that we can bring you this
Terrance & Phillip Television Special</i>

13
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:27,251
Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having
a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?

14
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:31,380
It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe
this steer I'm riding has the farts.

15
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:39,562
Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Muhammad,
the holy prophet of the Muslim religion?

16
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:44,131
Hey guys, how's it going?

17
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:47,895
Hello Muhammad,
we've read all aboat you in the Koran.

18
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,971
I'm hear to investigate a murder.

19
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:52,884
All right, just what the hell is going on here?!

20
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,255
You censored out the image
of Muhammad in our television special!

21
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:00,477
Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show
the image of Muhammad anymore. It's dangerous.

22
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:02,067
But you ruined the whole show!

23
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,428
Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives
of the people at this network.

24
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,442
Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?

25
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,581
Aw, come on guys, give me a break.

26
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:14,829
We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy
"J" Ranch with Muhammad uncensored!

27
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:16,927
Ey! I run this network, not you guys!

28
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,775
And if you ask me,
your show has become so preachy

29
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:21,207
and full of messages that you've
forgotten how to be funny! No Muhammad!

30
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:24,943
But Family Guy is going to show Muhammad
on an episode that airs tonight!

31
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:26,093
I doubt it!

32
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:30,136
I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way
to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.

33
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:45,427
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president
of this network right away.

34
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,135
What is it regarding?

35
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:48,778
It's regarding Family Guy.

36
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:51,729
I demand that the Muhammad episode
be pulled before it airs tonight!

37
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:55,403
It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims
and people can get hurt!

38
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:57,556
It's wrong!
It's wrooong!

39
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:02,180
Okay, but if you've got a problem with
Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.

40
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,543
That little boy over there has an appointment
to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether.

41
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:11,237
Dude, can I go before you?

42
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,799
Eat my shorts!

43
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:21,375
What the hell is going on?

44
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:25,521
Hello?

45
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:29,007
Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.

46
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,576
Hey!

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,405
Hello?!

48
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:39,891
<i>...starting in a small town
in central Colorado.</i>

49
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:42,950
<i>The idea has now spread all over America.</i>

50
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:45,366
<i>Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East,</i>

51
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:49,102
<i>demanding that Family Guy
not air tonight's episode.</i>

52
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,730
<i>And Muslim terrorists continue to make threats.</i>

53
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:55,997
<i>"Family Guy" better not show Mohammed tonight.</i>

54
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,882
<i>I'm serious.</i>

55
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,421
<i>"Family Guy" isn't funny.</i>

56
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:02,116
<i>Osama bin Laden had this to say:</i>

57
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:07,985
<i>If you look closely at
the writing in "Family Guy",</i>

58
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:11,989
<i>you will see that the jokes
never derive from the plot,</i>

59
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:14,816
<i>and I think that's totally gay.</i>

60
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:19,653
<i>Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy
shows the image of Muhammad as planned,</i>

61
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:23,049
<i>the terrorist retaliation will be immediate.</i>

62
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:25,602
You one of them?

63
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,338
Who?

64
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:28,435
How come your head ain't in the sand?

65
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:37,399
So...

66
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:39,761
you don't like Family Guy either, huh?

67
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:43,294
I hate Family Guy.

68
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:44,915
So what's your plan?

69
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:48,179
You're gonna ask the president of the network
nicely to take it off the air?

70
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:50,067
Not nicely.

71
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,839
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show,
all you have to do is get an episode pulled.

72
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,547
Pretty soon the show is compromised
and it goes off the air.

73
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,811
Cool, man.

74
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,582
Yes. So my plan is to use
this whole Muhammad thing

75
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:04,267
as a way to scare the network
into pulling tonight's show.

76
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:06,799
I'm going to use fear to get
them to do what I want.

77
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:10,035
Isn't that like, terrorism?

78
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:14,335
No, it isn't like terrorism.
It is terrorism.

79
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,557
I could do that.

80
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:18,329
This is manipulation at its highest level,
you should let me handle this.

81
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:20,033
I'm a pretty bad kid.

82
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:22,242
Really?
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

83
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:24,580
I stole the head of a statue once.

84
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,704
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
Geez.

85
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:30,079
That's like this one time,
when I didn't like a kid,

86
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,341
so I ground his parents up into chili
and fed it to him.

87
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:37,819
You got it, man.
You got it.

88
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:38,946
Seeya.

89
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:46,919
I want to assure the American
people that as President,

90
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,571
I have exhausted every possible solution.

91
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:54,850
Unfortunately, Mohammed will appear
uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven.

92
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,392
Mr. President, can't the writers
of the show be reasoned with?

93
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,614
Don't they know they're
putting the country in danger?

94
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:08,286
I have come to... understand something
about the Family Guy writing staff.

95
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:13,319
Suffice it to say that they will not be
persuaded by the possibility of violence.

96
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:19,902
What exactly did you learn about
the Family Guy writing staff, Mr. President?

97
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,164
I'm afraid that information is classified.

98
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:31,726
Mr. President, can't you force the Family Guy
writing staff not to write anything about Mohammed?

99
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,320
Couldn't you throw them in prison?

100
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,901
Look! The fact of the matter is
the Family Guy writing staff

101
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:40,304
is protected by something
called the First Amendment!

102
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,206
And what exactly is
this First Amendment, Mr. President?

103
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:48,425
Uh you know, the right to free speech.

104
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:57,606
Mr. President, when your administration
came up with this "First Amendment",

105
00:06:57,606 --> 00:07:00,628
did it not foresee a problem
like this might happen?

106
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:02,253
Well...

107
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:05,892
We didn't come up with the First Amendment.
It was already in place.

108
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:09,832
What do you intend to do about
this "First Amendment," Mr. President?

109
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,500
Forgive me, Mr. President,

110
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,681
but this "First Amendment" sounds like
a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob?

111
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,716
Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.

112
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:25,765
Sir, there's still one little boy out here

113
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:28,695
who wants to speak with you
about pulling the Family Guy episode.

114
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,660
All right, let's get this over with.

115
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:35,096
Hello, gentlemen, ladies.

116
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:38,540
My name is little Danny Pocket.
And I won't take much of your time.

117
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,541
Please excuse my tiny crutch,
it's the only way I can get around these days.

118
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,264
Oh, poor kid...

119
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:46,742
You see,

120
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,862
my father worked for a newspaper
in my native country of Denmark.

121
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,085
His newspaper showed
an image of Muhammad and,

122
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:55,293
two days later,
terrorists suicides bombed his building.

123
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,162
I was in the lobby when it happened.

124
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:00,370
First one terrorist suicide bombed us
and then dozens more.

125
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:01,634
They just kept coming.

126
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,745
Suicide bombers running in the building
and blowing up one after another!

127
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,998
They were like Mexican jumping beans.

128
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,943
I just don't wanna see people here
at your studio getting hurt, because...

129
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:15,027
that would be, of course, your responsibility.

130
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:19,552
I feel terrible.

131
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:24,859
It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until
one of its victims is staring you in the face.

132
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:29,275
Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy
writing staff will refuse to work again.

133
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:32,817
Little boy, will you talk
to the Family Guy writing staff?

134
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,776
If your story touches their
hearts like it has ours,

135
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,792
perhaps they'll back down from
demanding we air the episode.

136
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,743
I'll certainly do my best.

137
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:44,877
Take this noble child over
to the Family Guy offices.

138
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,419
If he can scare them like he has us,
maybe we can pull the Muhammad episode after all.

139
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,797
Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.

140
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:54,128
What was that?
- I said "thank you".

141
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,810
Thank you for listening.

142
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:02,933
Thanks a lot for the ride.

143
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,943
Ey, it's the least I could do.

144
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:06,665
I hope you succeed, kid.

145
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,879
I really don't wanna see Family Guy
go off the air. I love that show!

146
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,464
I'll do everything I can.

147
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,866
I mean, I know it's just joke
after joke, but I like that.

148
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:19,522
At least it doesn't get all preachy
and up its own ass with messages, you know?

149
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,164
Excuse me.

150
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:33,233
Do you know which way
the network president's office is?

151
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,747
Who wants to know?!

152
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:38,814
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick
the network into getting Family Guy off the air.

153
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:43,594
The network president's office is in there!

154
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:47,924
Oh thanks, dude.
- No problem, man.

155
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,271
Hello?

156
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:53,640
This can't be right, I-

157
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:57,446
Cowabunga, motherfucker!

158
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:04,937
Hello Mitchell.
- Oh hi, Miss Travis.

159
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:07,766
The president has asked
that little Danny Pocket here

160
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:10,197
speak with the Family Guy writing staff.

161
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,634
Are you sure?
They're working on a new episode right now.

162
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:15,163
It won't take long, sir.

163
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,746
All right, I'll take him back.
Follow me, little Danny.

164
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,760
You must be excited.
Not many people get to meet our writing staff.

165
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:26,924
Yes, I'm totally excited.
Family Guy is so funny.

166
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,007
Well, here we are.

167
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:32,948
Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.

168
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:34,746
Wha?

169
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:43,706
What are they?

170
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:46,998
They're manatees. Gretchen and Flubber
are from the Gulf of Mexico.

171
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,776
Tinker, Pete and Lucy
are from the Caribbean Sea.

172
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,595
Family Guy is written by manatees?

173
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:55,281
Of course, it all makes sense now.

174
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:56,930
They really are brilliant creatures.

175
00:10:56,963 --> 00:11:00,013
You see, the right side of the tank
is filled with idea balls.

176
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,701
Each ball has a verb, noun or pop
culture reference written on it.

177
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:05,006
There's millions of them.

178
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:06,766
The manatees choose an idea ball

179
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,780
and swim it over to the joke combine
on the other side of the tank.

180
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:12,387
Uh there goes Gretchen!
She's comin' up with an idea.

181
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:15,114
Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman.

182
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:19,434
The idea balls drop into the joke combine
and form part of the new script.

183
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:24,161
Loundry Date, Winning, Mexico, Gary Coleman.

184
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:27,175
A perfect Family Guy joke!
I can see it now!

185
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,488
<i>Peter, you didn't do the laundry today.</i>

186
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:36,440
<i>You think that's bad? Remember the time
I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?</i>

187
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,541
<i>¿Qué pasa, señores?
- Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?</i>

188
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:44,221
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute.
These manatees demanded that Muhammad be shown?

189
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:45,888
How?
Manatees don't talk!

190
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,139
When FOX censored the image
of Muhammad last week,

191
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,972
it also meant that the Muhammad ball
had to come out of the idea tank.

192
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,198
It made the manatees very upset.

193
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,677
Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank
and the manatees stop working.

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,212
He-here, I'll show you.
Keith?

195
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,140
All right all right, put it back in!

196
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,242
Manatees are very ethical writers.

197
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,117
Either everything's okay to write
about or nothing is.

198
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:21,908
Anyway, the president of the network
wanted you to speak with the manatees.

199
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,521
Oh... yes, yes.

200
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:29,324
Hello, manatees. I think you should allow the
network to pull your episode with Muhammad.

201
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:33,470
See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack
and... terrorists might come after you if you-

202
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,627
That isn't gonna work on them.
- Why not?

203
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,636
Don't you know anything about manatees?

204
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:41,234
They're the only mammals that are
completely unmoved by terrorst threats.

205
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,845
Son of a bitch.

206
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:48,952
Get me out of here, kid!
Why are you doing this?

207
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:51,160
Well well well!

208
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,367
Cartman!
- Hello, Kyle.

209
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:57,475
Looks like you've run into
a little snag in your plan as well.

210
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,961
You fat son of a bitch!

211
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:01,326
You came so close to stopping me,
didn't you, Kyle.

212
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:03,274
There was just one thing you didn't count on.

213
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:06,941
That more people besides me hate Family Guy.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:09,562
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too!

215
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:11,340
Who are you to decide
it shouldn't be on the air?!

216
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:14,118
Shut up!
You shut your fucking face, man!

217
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:17,476
Did it work? Did you scare
the network into pulling the episode?

218
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:20,379
Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan.

219
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:23,512
I've learned how to make the
Family Guy writing staff stop working!

220
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:26,943
As soon as everyone goes on their
lunch break, I can sneak back in.

221
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:27,951
Cool man!

222
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:30,160
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!

223
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:33,229
Good, Kyle! That's good anger
you're showin' there! See that?!

224
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,865
That's emotional character development
based on what's happening in the storyline!

225
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:41,494
Not at all like Family Guy.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle.

226
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:45,585
I've got some idea balls to
remove from a manatee tank.

227
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,227
What?!

228
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:50,853
I don't understand it.
What's wrong with them?

229
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:56,887
We don't know, Mr. President.
They just stopped working.

230
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,901
But, nobody took any idea balls
out of the tank, did they?

231
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:01,770
No sir, none of us did.

232
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,391
Then why are they refusing to write?

233
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,904
I agreed to show Muhammad uncensored!

234
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:10,789
I did what you asked!
What do you want from me?!

235
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,233
Sir! Sir!

236
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,240
If you don't my saying,
I think you asked for this.

237
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:17,902
You gave in to the manatees last week.

238
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:21,166
Now they know all they have to do is refuse
to work and they can get whatever they want.

239
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,819
You spoiled them by caving in.

240
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:24,756
Now they thnk they can walk all over you.

241
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:28,122
Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them.

242
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,897
Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.

243
00:14:31,994 --> 00:14:33,216
You're right.

244
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:37,345
It's time I stop letting these
primadonna manatees tell me what to do!

245
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,805
I'm pulling the Muhammad episode, you got that?!

246
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:43,499
And if you all don't want to work tomorrow,
you can just find other jobs!

247
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,486
How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!

248
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:46,569
Twenty-five minutes.

249
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:47,762
I gotta hurry!

250
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,401
I did it.

251
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:53,358
I... am... God!

252
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:56,386
Family Guy is going off the air!

253
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:58,616
No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!

254
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:00,110
C artman!

255
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,402
You fucking fatass!

256
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:04,950
How the hell did you get out?

257
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:07,031
That kid and I had a long talk!

258
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:10,337
I told him he was on a slippery
slope to becoming a monster like you!

259
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:13,184
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one
of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!

260
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:15,795
You are not killing Family Guy!

261
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,533
You're too late, Kyle! The president
of the network is pulling the episode!

262
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,506
Family Guy is as good as dead!

263
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,700
There's still time to tell the network
president you're full of crap!

264
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,643
I can't let you do that!
- Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!

265
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:30,948
Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.

266
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,305
Let this be our final battle.

267
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,192
Stop it!
Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!

268
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,236
Kyle! Stop it!

269
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,153
Quit it!
- Quit it, Kyle!

270
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:48,500
Kyle!

271
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,508
Stop it!

272
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,286
Quit it!
- Quit it, Kyle!

273
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,008
Kyle! Let go-

274
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:58,413
Okay okay come on, time out.

275
00:15:58,413 --> 00:15:59,760
Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.

276
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,558
Time in!

277
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,669
Okay. Okay. Time out!

278
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,107
Kyle time out! Time out! Time out!

279
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:10,885
No more tmieouts, fatass!
- Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle!

280
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:21,820
Kyle!

281
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:24,236
Get the- Kyle!

282
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,264
Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls!

283
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:28,389
Dude, serious- seriously!
That was in the balls!

284
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,799
No hitting- No hitting in the balls!

285
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,146
Kyle!

286
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:45,078
Quit it, Kyle.

287
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:47,550
Give it up, Kyle!

288
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:54,331
Okay...

289
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,623
Okay! Okay okay!
You win!

290
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:01,072
You win.
I give up.

291
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,879
I had my fingers crossed.

292
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:14,273
Thanks, kid.

293
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:17,088
Network Control!
This is the President!

294
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,199
I want you to pull the episode.

295
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,733
What?
Mr. President, are you sure?

296
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:27,538
I'm sure.
Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900.

297
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,278
<i>Voice System initiated.</i>

298
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:34,483
Awaiting confirmation.

299
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:37,366
Mr. President, we need your final approval code.

300
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:40,363
President approval code 0-0-destruct-

301
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:43,085
Sir! Mister television executive!
Stop!

302
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:43,881
Who are you?

303
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:47,719
Listen to me, the little boy who convinced
you to pull the episode is a bastard child.

304
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:51,303
He only wants you to pull it because he knows
it will be the end of Family Guy forever!

305
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,511
The end of Family Guy?

306
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:54,933
Mr. President, we need final authorization!

307
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:57,128
Hold on, Julie!
What are you talking about, kid?

308
00:17:57,141 --> 00:18:00,015
Pulling an episode because someone
is offended starts a chain reaction.

309
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:03,224
You'll have to pull more and more episodes
until the show goes off the air completely.

310
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,105
It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

311
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,939
You mean...
the manatees aren't trying to run the network?

312
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,633
What manatees?!

313
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,647
Go ahead, Mr. President!
Continue what you were doing!

314
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:16,120
No!
You have to show Muhammad, Mr. President!

315
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:18,321
Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!

316
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:20,904
Sir, just think about what
you're doing to free speech!

317
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,308
No!
Think about the people who could get hurt!

318
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,393
I don't know who to listen to!

319
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,155
Okay, I'll make it easy for you

320
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,728
Pull the Muhammad episode, now!

321
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,062
Okay, I'll listen to you.

322
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,901
Julie?
- No! Wait!

323
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:36,860
You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful
monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!

324
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,110
But he has a gun.

325
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:42,242
You can't do what he wants just because
he's the one threatening you with violence!

326
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:43,311
Shut up, Kyle!

327
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:46,811
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt.
Especially me.

328
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:50,005
Yes, people can get hurt.
That's how terrorism works.

329
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:53,449
But if you give into that, Doug,
you're allowing terrorism to work.

330
00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:54,945
Do the right thing here.

331
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:57,084
Give the orders to pull
the episode, Mr. President!

332
00:18:57,209 --> 00:19:01,225
I shouldn't even be in the office still.
It's supposed to be half-day Friday.

333
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:04,922
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime.
What do you want us to do?!

334
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,783
Do the right thing, Mr. President.

335
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:10,419
How about I allow the episode to air but,
just censor out the image of Muhammad again.

336
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:11,891
I wish that was good enough.

337
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:15,419
But if you censor out Muhammad,
then soon you'll have to censor out more.

338
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:16,840
No gay speeches, Kyle!

339
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:18,502
If you don't show Muhammad,

340
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:22,291
then you've made a distinction what
is okay to poke fun at and what isn't.

341
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,847
Either it's all okay, or none of it is.

342
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,641
Five seconds, Mr. President.

343
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:31,234
Do the right thing. Show Mohammed.

344
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,991
Do the right thing.

345
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:37,069
Mr. President, we need a decision now.

346
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:42,392
<i>Family Guy goes on air
as planned. Uncensored.</i>

347
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,314
- Yes.
- No.

348
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:47,427
<i>No, I hate Family Guy!</i>

349
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:51,465
Air it.

350
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:00,470
Peter, you got a pink slip at work?

351
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:02,314
You think that's bad?

352
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,745
Remember the time
I got a salmon helmet

353
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,832
from Mohammed while wearing a toga?

354
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:09,948
Coming, Mohammed!

355
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:25,955
Wow! A salmon helmet! Thanks!

356
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:28,672
Anyway, what were we talking about?

357
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:30,593
<i>Oh, yeah, my pink slip.</i>

358
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,146
Hey, that wasn't bad at all.

359
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:36,473
They just showed Mohammed
standing there, looking normal!

360
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:39,064
Mr. President,
the terrorists are retaliating!

361
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,265
What?

362
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,833
<i>And as soon as the image
of Mohammed appeared,</i>

363
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:46,028
<i>terrorist leader Al-Zawahri
announced the retaliation!</i>

364
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:04,952
<i>- Hello, I am American!
- I'm American, too!</i>

365
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:07,271
<i>We like to crap on each other!</i>

366
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:11,594
<i>Hello, I am the President Bush,
I will crap on both of you.</i>

367
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:13,993
<i>Oh, we love to crap!</i>

368
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:15,231
<i>I'm American!</i>

369
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:17,392
<i>I'm pregnant with a baby,
but I'm not married.</i>

370
00:21:17,516 --> 00:21:18,949
<i>Let's crap.</i>

371
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:21,549
<i>Look at me, I'm Jesus.</i>

372
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:24,474
<i>Would you like me
to crap on you, Mr. Bush?</i>

373
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:28,506
<i>Yummy, yummy crap.</i>
