1
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:42,051
Being a delivery boy for the South
Park Gazette is a moble privilege.

2
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,898
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that...

3
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:45,872
I have to get up at 4
a.m. to deliver your paper

4
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:46,963
and then I go to school all day.

5
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,641
Oh waaa waaa waaa!

6
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,254
We've all got problems,
pussy! Get used to it!

7
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:53,427
You aren't delivering
the papers on time!

8
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:55,537
My bike had a busted
pedal, but I got it fixed,

9
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:57,250
so there won't be a problem anymore.

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,108
Is that your bike out there?

11
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:00,293
Yeah. Why?

12
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,790
'Cause it's being towed.

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,984
What??

14
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:06,197
Hey hey! What are you doing?!

15
00:01:06,197 --> 00:01:07,915
- This your bike?
- Yes!

16
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:11,129
It's on the impound list. You
owe the county for tickets.

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,625
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!

18
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,897
Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike.

19
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:19,976
You want it back? You
talk to the county.

20
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:23,129
No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!

21
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:25,223
Stop, asshole!

22
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,518
Yes? Come in.

23
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,812
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh.

24
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:43,353
I was told to come
down here and try to-

25
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,671
Yehss! Come on, Mr. Marsh.

26
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,570
I've been told all about your case.

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,838
Impounded bicycle,
$83 owed to the county.

28
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:51,562
Maybe you should get a job.

29
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:54,544
I got a job, but without my
bike to do my paper route,

30
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:56,392
I can't make the money! See?

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,195
Stan Marsh is a bright young man.

32
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:05,302
He's got a great family,
a promising paper route;

33
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:09,732
only problem is, his
bike's been impounded!

34
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:17,121
But now, he's about to find out that
getting his bike back isn't so easy.

35
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,070
Look, I really need my bike.

36
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,563
Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you,
because then you wouldn't learn anything..

37
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,342
What do I have to
learn?! This isn't fair!

38
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:29,726
Whoa whoa, hold on.

39
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:33,811
I've looked your case over and I think
maybe we can cut a little deal here.

40
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,377
According to your background check,
when you were in kindergarten,

41
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:40,495
you played on the Park
County Pee Wee Hockey Team.

42
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:42,455
...Yeah?

43
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:47,410
Well it just so happens that the pee
wee hockey team this year needs a coach.

44
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,769
Me?

45
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:52,416
Stan Marsh is a
washed-up fourth grader.

46
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:57,608
He's got no job, no bicycle. And
his only way out is to coach...

47
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:00,073
a pee wee hockey team!

48
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:06,869
And now, he's about to find out
that to coach, you've got to grow.

49
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,540
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys,
over here? Come over here.

50
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:27,859
We've got a lot of work to do
and not much time to do it in.

51
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,521
Who are you?

52
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,709
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach.

53
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,010
Now we just need to kind of organize
a little bit and practice our-

54
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,145
Coach, I have to go pohhtty.

55
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:40,135
All right, fine, go ahead.

56
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,499
...By myself?

57
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:43,872
S- hold it a while, okay?

58
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:46,479
What does "passing" mean?

59
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,189
When you shoot the
puck to another player.

60
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:51,728
My mommy said I'm as big as the sky.

61
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:54,276
Coach, Wooden spit on my forehead!

62
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,647
I did not!

63
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:58,051
All right, all right, shut
up! We're gonna practice!

64
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,581
You two guys play defense,
and you play goalie.

65
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:03,291
I can't play goalie.

66
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,352
Why not?!

67
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:07,687
My doctor says I'm not supposed to.

68
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,296
What, you got asthma or something?

69
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:11,877
No, he has cancer.

70
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:13,725
What?

71
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:18,311
Nelson has leukemia. It's
already spread to his bone marrow.

72
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,802
I don't wanna have cancer!

73
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:25,926
Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.

74
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:28,346
But why me, coach? Why?

75
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:32,245
Coach, why do people get caaancer?

76
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:34,208
Oh Jesus, can we just practice?

77
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,417
Are we gonna get cancer if
we play with Nelson, Coach?

78
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:38,633
NO!

79
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:43,465
Well well well! If it isn't
the Park County Losers!

80
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,990
Oh no! Adams County!

81
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,785
We just thought we'd come check
out the ice for the game tomorrow.

82
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,101
Gavin Throttle, coach
of the Adams County team.

83
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,084
Hey.

84
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:55,977
Look, why don't you just give up?

85
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:59,350
You can't beat us. You really
want to embarass your players?

86
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,735
Our coach isn't gonna let us lose!

87
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,022
Yeah!!

88
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,049
Fine, if that's the way you want it.

89
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:07,626
See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!

90
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:09,183
Right! Follow!

91
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:14,880
Coach, please don't let
us lose to Adams County.

92
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,417
My daddy will beat me again.

93
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:23,636
Jesus Christ.

94
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:26,247
Stanley, where have you
been?! It's almost bedtime!

95
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:29,793
Your mother's been worried
sick, and I've been watching TV!

96
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:33,502
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be
able to pay off all the money I owe.

97
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:34,763
Oh, well that's good.

98
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:36,061
What kind of job?

99
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:38,437
I'm working with the
Pee Wee Hockey League.

100
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,334
...What? With the ..?

101
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:41,595
What whoa wait, Stan.

102
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:44,107
You gave up playing
hockey a long time ago.

103
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:45,602
I'm not playing, I'm coaching.

104
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:49,011
Have you forgotten what
happened all those years ago?

105
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:51,812
Or are you just trying
to make up for it?

106
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,260
What are you talking about?

107
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,302
Your Pee Wee hockey
game! The Pepsi Center?!

108
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,862
In between periods of
the Colorado Avalanche?

109
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,820
I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.

110
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,899
Stan, you can't put your
family through this again!

111
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,398
Whatever your reasons are!

112
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,297
I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed.

113
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,472
What are we goin' to do, Sharon??

114
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:11,169
What?

115
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:12,234
Don't you get it?

116
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:15,201
He's getting back into hockey
to prove something to himself.

117
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,434
So he can forget what happened
in that Pee Wee skirmish.

118
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:20,758
Maybe he doesn't
remember. He was only 4.

119
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:26,667
Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it
eats at him every single day.

120
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,171
And we're about out of time here in
another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game.

121
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:39,174
And that's # 7, Stan Marsh,
skeating towards the goal, sort of,

122
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:40,818
but he doesn't have the puck.

123
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:48,806
I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em!

124
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:52,584
Oh, it appears the goalie
has pooped his pants.

125
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,086
Oh and look at this!

126
00:06:57,086 --> 00:06:59,991
Little Stan Marsh actually
has a shot at the goal!

127
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:01,899
Ohhhh!

128
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,682
Stan?? Shoot it!

129
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:08,161
Time is running out. Stan
Marsh with a chance to win!

130
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,053
You got it, Stan!

131
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:14,708
Take the shot!! Take the shot!!

132
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:27,461
NOOOOOOOOOOO!

133
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,894
Ohoooo, that's the end of
the game! How disappointing.

134
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:38,382
Randy, what's wrong??

135
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:41,972
OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible!

136
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:44,787
It was like I was
living ti all over again.

137
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:51,520
All right, guys. Tonight is our
big game against Adams County.

138
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,322
We still have all day to practice.

139
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,160
Coach? Hey coach.

140
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,395
Could we talk to you, please?

141
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:01,623
We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?

142
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,303
Oh

143
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,423
Our little Nelson, he's... taken
a turn for the worse, I'm afraid!

144
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:09,723
His cancer is...
real ba-a-a-ad.

145
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,145
Ohhh

146
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:14,602
Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it.

147
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,208
How am I supposed to do it, coach?

148
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,544
How do I look a five year old child in
the eye and tell him he's not gonna live?

149
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:22,504
You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!

150
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:25,549
Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean
to take it out on you, coach.

151
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:28,649
No, I don't mean to take it
out on you, coach. It's just...

152
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,993
I don't know what to say to
him, coach. Neither of us do.

153
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:35,453
What do you say tuh...
somebody who's dying, huh?

154
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:38,853
... I don't know.

155
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:42,522
Will you talk to him,
coach? He looks up to you.

156
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,905
No, I think you oughta.

157
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,923
Nah, I'm just his father.

158
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:50,389
But you're his coach!
You're like a father to him.

159
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,564
Please, coach, he's...

160
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,824
he's counting on you!

161
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,762
Please, coach, he's counting on you!

162
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:01,972
Oh uh, hey Nelson.

163
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,098
Hi, coach.

164
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:07,106
Dude, I can come back later.
Is this a bad time for you?

165
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:10,749
Yeah, it's a pretty
bad time for me, coach.

166
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:14,156
I'm only five and I'm dying.

167
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:18,997
Coach, what's it like when you die?

168
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:21,404
Wugh, I'm not sure.

169
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:25,344
I would... think that... it's a lot
like it was before you were born?

170
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:28,388
How come I have to die now?

171
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,967
I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?

172
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,265
Goddamnit, dude, I don't know.

173
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:35,381
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:37,964
No, what I mean is,
nobody really knows, see?

175
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:38,956
But everyonen does it.

176
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:41,473
I mean, it's not like everyone else
gets to live and only you have to die.

177
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:44,924
Everyone's gonnan die.
You feel better now?

178
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:46,367
I think so.

179
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:47,178
Okay, great.

180
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:51,439
Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium,
but uh... hang in there? All right?

181
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:53,202
Thanks, coach.

182
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:59,173
Will you do me just one favor,
Coach? That game tonight?

183
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:05,405
I'm gonna be watching, so... could
you... make it so I don't have cancer?

184
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:08,757
No dude, I told you I can't do that.

185
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:12,772
Well then, will you just... win for me?

186
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,313
Okay.

187
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:24,144
Stan Marsh has always
lived a carefree life.

188
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:26,096
But in the blink of an eye,

189
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:30,915
what seemed important before
can all be put in perspective.

190
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:35,278
Stan Marsh is... "Bummin' on Cancer."

191
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:45,015
Welcome, parents, to
this Pee Wee hockey match

192
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:48,135
between Park County and Adams County.

193
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:54,558
Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!

194
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:56,089
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?

195
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,477
Come to surrender, coach?

196
00:10:58,477 --> 00:11:01,177
Look, there's a kid in
my team who's got cancer,

197
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,227
aaand, he wants us to
win this game really bad,

198
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,722
so, could you just...
give us kind of a break?

199
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:08,106
HA! I don't think so, Coach.

200
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:11,294
We're gonna beat you into
the ground, cancer or no!

201
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:15,502
Win! Win! Win! Win!

202
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,537
All right, guys, listen.

203
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,293
I saw Nelson in the hospital,

204
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:24,598
and he asked me one thing: he said he
wanted us to win this game... for him.

205
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:29,855
Sooo, if we lose we're
gonna kill Nelson?

206
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,648
Oh Jesus, no!

207
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:34,544
I don't wanna be a murderer!

208
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:37,312
Relax! If we lose we're
not gonna be murderers.

209
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:40,013
If we lose are we gonna get cancer?

210
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,734
- Oh no
- Ohhh..

211
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,892
- Oh no.
- I don't want cancer.

212
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:56,022
They look pretty strong, coach.

213
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:58,580
I think Nelson's gonna die for sure.

214
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:05,071
Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it!

215
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:11,733
Yeah! Let's go Adams!

216
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,175
Let's go, Park! Come on!

217
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,820
That's it, Brian! Kill him!

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,639
Get near the puck!

219
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:17,251
And that's the end of the
game. The result is a tie.

220
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:20,023
Tie? Well, what does that mean?

221
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,972
Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all.

222
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:30,429
The big game. A dying
boy's hope. Only problem is,  he tied!

223
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:36,437
And now, he's about to find out
that tying isn't the same as winning.

224
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,718
So did we kill Nelson or not?

225
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:41,915
Hello?

226
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:45,460
Coach.

227
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,102
How are you feeling?

228
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:51,047
I feel pretty good,
except for the cancer.

229
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:55,742
Coach? Does God hate me?

230
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:57,078
Oh, hello Coach.

231
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:58,996
Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?

232
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:02,130
Well, he isn't worse, but,
he isn't getting better.

233
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,425
It's almost as if...
his cancer were tied.

234
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,510
Oh boy.

235
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,790
Oh. My cancer hurts.

236
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,839
He seems to have put all his
hope into you winning that game.

237
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,677
And with a tie, he's in
a kind of... cancer limbo.

238
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:20,018
But what can I do?

239
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:22,976
Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news!

240
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:27,131
Our hockey team has just been
invited to play against Denver County

241
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:29,476
during a Colorado Avalanche game!

242
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:32,606
Wow. At the Pepsi Center?

243
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,228
Look! He's coming around again.

244
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:37,109
That's our biggest game ever.

245
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,013
Do you think we can win, Coach?

246
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,287
Well, ah, I mean...

247
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:50,047
Imagine. If there was one game, one
chance, to make everything right.

248
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:53,017
Stan Marsh is being given that chance.

249
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:57,476
But to win, he's gonna have
to pull out all the stops in...

250
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,675
"Stanley's Cup"! Rated R.

251
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:06,548
Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.

252
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:10,511
All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.

253
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:13,411
Just be aware of this, Coach.

254
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:17,549
If you lose the Big Game, that
little boy is going to die faster

255
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,866
than Steve Irwin in a
tank full of stingrays.

256
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,635
Coach! What the hell were you thinking?

257
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:28,124
We can't beat Denver County.

258
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:29,257
Well, sure we can.

259
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:34,009
Last time we played Denver
they scored seven times.

260
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:35,924
Look, guys. I believe in you.

261
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:38,524
Nelson believes in you.
Doesn't that count for anything?

262
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:41,180
No, 'cause they're gonna kill us.

263
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,505
They're not gonna kill us.

264
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:46,430
That's what Steve Irwin
said about those stingrays.

265
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:51,139
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies?

266
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,547
We're just supposed to rally together,

267
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:54,663
believe in ourselves,
and we win in the end.

268
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,697
No. In the movies, they always go out

269
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:01,422
and find a kid who's really
good to join the team.

270
00:16:02,013 --> 00:16:04,447
Hey that's right. We need a ringer.

271
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:07,098
We need a Canadian.

272
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,570
Wow, he's good.

273
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,971
Yeah!

274
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:23,591
Stan, I told you. My mom
doesn't want Ike playing hockey.

275
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:24,825
She thinks it's dangerous.

276
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,781
It's just for one game. He
won't get hurt, I promise.

277
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:30,960
Yeah!

278
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,292
All right, but it's gonna take more

279
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,291
than one good player to
beat the champions, Stan.

280
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,676
You'd better have a
really good game plan.

281
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:48,876
Can you believe it,
Stan? The Pepsi Center.

282
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:52,275
You're going back to the
place where it all happened.

283
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:55,666
Same place where you missed
that shot all those years ago.

284
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,305
Dad, I'm working on
my game plan right now.

285
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:59,263
Ya have to understand why I can't go.

286
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:04,283
I can't... sit there in that same crowd
and watch you destroy yourself again.

287
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:10,894
Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why
does it have to be the Pepsi Center?

288
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:16,762
All right, all right, I'll
go. No, no I WANT to go.

289
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:18,520
I'm gonna be there for you and...

290
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,948
I'll be rooting louder than
anybody, saying "That's my son!"

291
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:28,021
And just remember, Stan: win or lose.

292
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:33,505
Those are your two
options, Win, or lose.

293
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:51,468
His shot is blocked! What a great save!

294
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,674
And that's the end of the second
period. The score is tied 2-all.

295
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:02,381
And now please put your hands
together for three minutes

296
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,505
of exhibition play from some of our
state's finest Pee Wee hockey players.

297
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:09,894
All right, you guys, this
is it. The moment is here.

298
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,297
We've been through a lot together,

299
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,168
and according to every movie ever made,

300
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:15,609
we're going to win this game.

301
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,751
Just don't forget:

302
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:20,593
there's a little boy in the
hospital who's really counting on us.

303
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:23,136
So let's not let him
down. Are you with me?!

304
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:28,126
All right, let's go win!

305
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:31,211
Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight.

306
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,269
Huh?

307
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:33,978
The other Pee Wee hockey
team didn't show up.

308
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,363
There's nobody for you to play.

309
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,098
Thanks for makin' the trip though.

310
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:40,292
We came to play.

311
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:41,855
Sso then we win?

312
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,011
No. Nobody wins.

313
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:45,592
Hey. Hey, you can't do this.

314
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,957
We've, we've been through all
this stupid emotional crap!

315
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:50,151
Well, you've got nobody to
play, there's nothing we can do.

316
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:51,992
But it isn't supposed to end like this!

317
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:53,452
Hey, hold on a second.

318
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,823
If these kids have been through
a lot of emotional changes,

319
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:56,825
then they have to play.

320
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:57,669
Yeah

321
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,212
Well, who are they gonna play?

322
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,820
They can take our place.

323
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,098
Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.

324
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,436
Play the Red Wings?

325
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:08,141
Stan Marsh coaches a
Pee Wee hockey team.

326
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:13,298
But now, they're going to
play in the big leagues.

327
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:16,391
They've got small bodies but big hearts.

328
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:19,362
Stan Marsh is... going professional.

329
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,582
All right! Give 'em hell, boys!

330
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:22,360
All right! Yeah!

331
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,578
It's a tie game here in Colorado as
we get set to start the final period.

332
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:28,036
Your attention, please:

333
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:32,130
for this third and final period, the
Detroit Red Wings will be playing...

334
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,415
the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.

335
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:46,472
OHHHHHHHHH!

336
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:47,921
Jesus Christ!

337
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,994
Stop ! Stop this !

338
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:53,813
Let them play!

339
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:57,447
Let them play! Let them play!

340
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,603
EEEK-ugh

341
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:06,266
Hey, can they do that??

342
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:09,142
Ow, no. Oh!

343
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,072
AAAGH!

344
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:28,483
Yeah! We did it! We did it!

345
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:54,016
NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO!

346
00:20:58,078 --> 00:21:01,615
I hate you, Coach. I hate you.

347
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,856
Thank you, Dad.

348
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:14,706
I'm proud of you, boy.

349
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:33,063
Red Wings! Red Wings!

350
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:37,604
No hope. No hope.

351
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:43,831
Red Wings! Red Wings!
