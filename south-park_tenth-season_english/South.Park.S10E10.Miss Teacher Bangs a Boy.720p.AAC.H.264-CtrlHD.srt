1
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:39,485
And so then,
I put my finger up my butthole, right?

2
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:42,540
And I walked up to Kelly Nelson
and I said, "Do you smell lemon grrass?"

3
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:46,793
And she smelled my finger and puked!
Oh, guys, you should have been there.

4
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:49,761
Eric, I have to take
you to the principal's office.

5
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,747
What?! I didn't do it.
Kelly Nelson is a lair!

6
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,982
I've been instructed to bring
you to the principals office.

7
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:57,861
Oh, suck my balls you
ginger Jew rat hall monitor!

8
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,183
Punkass stoolie,
who the fuck do you think you are?!

9
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:02,612
I just doing my job.
- I just dadededeh.

10
00:01:02,716 --> 00:01:05,403
You why you are a hallway monitor?
Because you don't have any friends.

11
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:07,773
You should kill yourself.
You should kill yourself!

12
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:10,822
Eric Cartman, report to the
principals office immediately.

13
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,781
Ah, goddamnit!

14
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:15,000
Come on in, Eric.

15
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:18,723
I'm sorry, principal Victoria. I didn't
mean to do it, how could I been so foolish.

16
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:20,633
Eric, the reason why we called you in here is

17
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:24,110
because it's your turn to
be the school hallway monitor.

18
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:28,132
The hall monitor, me?
- You need to watch for bad behaviour.

19
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:32,242
And make that anyone in the hall
during class has an hall pass, m'okay.

20
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,482
If anyone doesn't, you have
the authority to bring them to me.

21
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:38,190
A... authority?

22
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:43,180
Now Eric, being the school hallway
monitor is a big responsibility, m'okay.

23
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:48,070
It is important you take the job seriously
and that you don't abuse the power.

24
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:49,673
Me?

25
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:55,081
<i>There's fear and darkness all around you</i>

26
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,092
<i>The criminals are on the run</i>

27
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:02,030
<i>No use in not having your hall pass</i>

28
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:05,372
<i>I'll take you to the principal
'cause I'm the Dawg</i>

29
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:09,253
<i>I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg</i>

30
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,010
<i>The Hallway Monitor!</i>

31
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:16,941
Hey, kid, get outta there.

32
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:19,682
That's cool, im done making my video anyways.

33
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:29,412
Hallpass!
Show me your hallpass!

34
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:30,770
What?!

35
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:34,900
You know what this is?
This is the mace they use on bears, faggot!

36
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,802
Now let me see your hallpass.
- It's right here.

37
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:40,253
Allright, cool, Rob.
Go with Christ.

38
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:40,981
What?!

39
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:43,012
You can't just push me up against the-

40
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:48,193
I am the dawg.
The big bad.

41
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:50,273
Oh, my god.

42
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:54,422
What the fuck is this?

43
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:59,052
And so this shape with four sides,
is what class?

44
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:04,010
Ike Browlofski.
You littering my hallway brah?

45
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,562
What are you doing?

46
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:09,922
I found this in the hallway.
Apparently your student Ike has an crush on you.

47
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:14,093
You got an crush on your teacher, brah?
Keep it out of my hallway. Go with Christ.

48
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:17,091
Here you go.
- I don't think that's really necessary.

49
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:20,713
Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class.
Don't tell me how to run my hallway.

50
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:26,160
Ike has a crush on teacher.
- Ike has a crush on teacher.

51
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,891
That's enough class.

52
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,580
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow everybody.

53
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:36,441
Ike, could you stay just a few minutes please?

54
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:42,960
Ike, i'm very flattered
by all of your love notes.

55
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,513
But I need to be clear.

56
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:47,250
See there's been alot of female teachers
on the news lately.

57
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:50,743
Who have been having relationships
with young male students and...

58
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:53,131
people might get the wrong idea.

59
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:56,002
Even though, I do admire you.

60
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:58,192
You are so smart and gifted.

61
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:00,621
So mature for your age.

62
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,021
I don't like Mason.

63
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:07,302
You listen and you really care
about what I have to say.

64
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:11,280
You make me feel things,
I never... felt before.

65
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:19,003
Ike, this is crazy.
I'm your teacher.

66
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:22,142
How can we been having
these feelings for eachother?

67
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,222
Your so mysterious.

68
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,321
And I can't... And I can't...

69
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:34,490
<i>And  I can't fight this feelin' anymore</i>

70
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:40,631
<i>I've forgotten what I started fightin' for</i>

71
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:45,272
<i>And if I have to crawl upon the floor</i>

72
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:48,411
<i>Come crashin' through your door</i>

73
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:56,980
<i>Baby, I cant fight this feelin' anymore</i>

74
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,330
That was unbelievable.

75
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:09,562
I've never felt like such a woman before.

76
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:14,622
They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't
let anybody know,they'll never understand.

77
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:19,952
We were ment to be, I know it.
How else can sex be that incredible?

78
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:24,991
Ike, made an nanoo.

79
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:35,081
Hey, there mr weener what ya know.
Do you need to tinkle tinkle?

80
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:36,983
Yes, I do think so.

81
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:39,020
Hands! Let me see those hands!

82
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:43,492
Show me your hallpass, brah.
- It's, it's... I just had it.

83
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:44,762
I knew it.

84
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:54,583
Look brah, I had to bring you in. But I don't
have any hard feelings against you, allright?

85
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:56,722
Huh?
- You need a smoke, brah?

86
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:58,322
Okay.

87
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,480
You gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
- I do?

88
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:04,512
Jesus is Lord.

89
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:07,753
You can one direction in life or you just
walk around in hallways without hallpass.

90
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,360
Or you can see the light, brah.

91
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:16,061
Kyle, I need you to go get your brother
over at his teachers house.

92
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:16,653
Huh?

93
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:20,330
Tell his teacher i'm sorry, but I forgot
he has an doctors appointment today.

94
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:22,271
What's he doing at his teachers house?

95
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:25,092
He's been going there in
the afternoons for private turdering

96
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:35,942
Hello?

97
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:39,632
Excuse me. I'm here to pickup Ike.

98
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,551
Uh, hallo. Is Ike here?

99
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,870
Hallo?

100
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,152
Oh God, i'm sorry. I didn't mean to,
I was looking for my brother.

101
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:56,562
Ike?

102
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,192
What the hell is going on?

103
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:03,340
Oh, what's the use Ike... were caught.

104
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:06,482
Hold on, please.
You don't understand.

105
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:08,723
Really? What's there not to understand?

106
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:10,480
Your brother and I...

107
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:11,961
are in love.

108
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,593
He's a little young, don't you think?

109
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:19,171
Ike is very mature for his age
and you know it.

110
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:23,502
He makes me feel like nobody else does.

111
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:27,200
He loves me and only me.
And I know I'm a godness to him.

112
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:30,023
When we make love he can give
it to me hard or soft and gentle-

113
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:32,000
Allright! We're getting the hell out of here!

114
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:37,453
Ike! You can't possible want this?
We have to tell mom!

115
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:44,101
Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?

116
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:46,903
This is nuts.

117
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:55,600
Mom, dad, have you ever
met Ike's kindergarten teacher?

118
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:59,300
Miss Stevensen?
Yes, she's very nice.

119
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:02,401
Yes, well she likes Ike a whole lot.
- That's great.

120
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:04,931
Yeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great.

121
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,400
Because to some degree, Ike
and miss Stevensen are having a-

122
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:08,282
Spider-Man!

123
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:13,103
Yes, Ike. You like Spider-Man, don't you?

124
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,490
Mom, there might be something
that you should look into

125
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:21,123
about  Ike staying after school all the time-
- Potcan.

126
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,101
Mommy, I love you, I love you.

127
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:26,403
Mommy, loves you to sweetie.

128
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,200
Would you excuse us for a second.

129
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:48,223
Mom, I think you should talk
to Ike about love and sex.

130
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:50,601
Sex?
Oh bubi, Ike is much to young.

131
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:57,602
Your so full of crap, Foley!
- What?

132
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,902
I did shoot him in the face.
Twice!

133
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,202
Ex... excuse me.

134
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,703
My name is... Brad.

135
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:07,801
And I need to report a crime.
Anonimously.

136
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:09,403
What's the crime?

137
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:11,951
Well I attend at South Park Elementary.
And... and...

138
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:14,807
One of the teachers is having sex with a student.

139
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:23,193
You did the right thing telling the police, Brad.
Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?

140
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:25,122
Well, it isn?t a guy teacher, its an woman.

141
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:26,002
A woman?

142
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,903
Yeah, she's having sex with a boy.

143
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:31,340
Oh, but she's ugly, right?
- No, not really.

144
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,911
It's the kindergarten teacher, miss Stevensen.
- The blonde?

145
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:34,803
Yeah.

146
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:38,330
Some youg boy is having sex with miss Stevensen?
- Yes.

147
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:40,651
Nice...

148
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:41,722
Nice...

149
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:42,521
What?!

150
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:44,993
No, you don't understand it.
- You sure they had sex?

151
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:45,852
Y es.

152
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:48,791
Has she performed oral sex on him?
- I think so.

153
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,500
Nice.
- Nice...

154
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:52,802
Niceee...

155
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,900
So wait, what's the crime?

156
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,700
The crime is, she isn't doing it with me.

157
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,002
Hey! He's totally under age!
She's taking advantage of him!

158
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:04,911
You're right, we're sorry.
This is serious.

159
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,952
We need to track this student down and...

160
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:09,432
and give him his Luckiest Boy
of America medal right away.

161
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,253
Guys, can I talk to you?
- Sure, dude.

162
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:24,082
I need you to keep quiet about this, right?

163
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:25,480
My little brother and his teacher-
- Brah's.

164
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:28,502
It's almost passed time, I need
you to start clear the hallways!

165
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:31,703
Not now, Cartmann.
I have really serious problems!

166
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:32,863
Dude, what's the matter?

167
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:35,401
The kindergarten teacher
is having sex with my brother.

168
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:39,430
Really?

169
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,241
Damn, brah. Your little brother is pretty cool.

170
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,083
It's not cool!
Ike isnt old enough to understand.

171
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:45,413
What's to understand?
You get a boner

172
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,023
slap her titties around some
and stick it inside her and pee.

173
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:52,512
Stick it inside her and pee?

174
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,242
Well, okay fine.
Unless you don't wanna get her pregnant.

175
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:57,060
Then you pull it out and pee on her leg.

176
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,443
Dude, I really don't see a problem.

177
00:10:58,496 --> 00:10:59,900
Yeah, I got bigger things to deal with.

178
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:02,681
You guys don't understand!
His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl.

179
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:06,102
They pass notes to eachother in class,
they have sex in her house over lunchbreak.

180
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:08,500
During class they sneak out
and kiss in the hallways.

181
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:11,153
They what?

182
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:13,820
They sneak out during class
and make out in the hallways.

183
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:17,350
Hang on a second. Making out in
the hallway is strictly against school policy.

184
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,712
Well there doing it.
- Well, yeah now it's personal.

185
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:23,051
The hallways are my juristriction.
If there is an hallway infraction going on...

186
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,972
they are gonna have to deal with the dawg.

187
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:31,182
Okay, just contineu with your macroni pictures.
The teacher has to step out for a second.

188
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,203
Ah, Ike. Could you help me out, please?

189
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:39,602
Oh, Ike. I just had to have
an second alone with you.

190
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:41,713
I like baba better.

191
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,290
I got your loveletter
and I wrote you one back.

192
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:47,421
Oh, just one kiss to hold me
over for the rest of the class.

193
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:50,501
Hall infraction!

194
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,982
Oh ah, we were just heading back in.

195
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,432
You got an hallpass, brah?

196
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:56,702
I dont need an hallpass, I'm a teacher.

197
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,083
Yeah, well were is his hallpass?

198
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:00,590
Look, just let us get back in.
- Get down on the floor!

199
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,190
We're going back inside.

200
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,852
You like bear mace, icehead?
- Bear mace?

201
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,910
Your going with Christ!

202
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:10,852
And thats what I got principal brah.

203
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,930
These two were in the hallways, making out.
She had those loveletters on her person.

204
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,802
"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me?"

205
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,702
Miss Stevensen!
Your having an relationship with your student?

206
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,723
Yes, during classtime, without an hallpass.

207
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,993
This is unbelievable.
- I know

208
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:29,213
it's like an hallpass doesnt even matter to her.

209
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:32,293
Miss Stevensen,
I will need to inform the police.

210
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:33,691
Oh God!

211
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:36,083
You just dealt with the dog, bitch!

212
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:43,300
Sorry we had to do this,
but the lady principal instisted.

213
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:45,703
What's going on?

214
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:49,301
The kindergarten teacher is suspected
with having sex with a student.

215
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:50,883
With a student?

216
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:53,032
But... she's a woman.

217
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,720
Yeah, I know.

218
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:57,123
But... she's hot.

219
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,303
Wow, I think I owe you one, Cartman.

220
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:03,203
You don't owe me anything.
My hallways are clean.

221
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:14,260
Ike, I didn't tell on you.
You got busted by the hallway monitor.

222
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,883
Okay, okay,
I did have something to do with it...

223
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:21,701
but someday your gonna
realize it was for the best.

224
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:23,700
You are dead to me.

225
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:25,733
What?

226
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,200
I said: Your dead to me.

227
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:31,703
I'm dead to you?

228
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,252
Your dead to me, Kyle!

229
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:39,330
I'm at the policestation.
They say they found some evidence.

230
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,480
I'm so scared.

231
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:44,750
Listen, I want you to know.
It's okay.

232
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:48,182
If anybody tries to talk to you,
you don't need to say anything.

233
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:49,271
Just  leave it to me.

234
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,873
I know a way out of this.

235
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:57,903
Tom, an elementary school teacher is
under arrest for an elegently having affair

236
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,703
with one of her young students.

237
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:01,370
The case is shocking.

238
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:05,430
Due mostly to the fact,
that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom.

239
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,150
If the accusations are true, then...

240
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,132
damn!

241
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:12,480
Looks like the defendant and her lawyer
are about to give a statement, Tom.

242
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:18,123
I am deeply sorry to announce that
the allegations against me are true.

243
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:24,201
Over the past several weeks, I have been having
physical relations with one of my students.

244
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:27,082
Nice.

245
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:28,262
Nice...

246
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:31,951
I know my actions were wrong,
but I cannot be fully to blame.

247
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,921
You see... I am an alcoholic.

248
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,080
Yes, I'm afraid its true.

249
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,840
Oh no!
- What?

250
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:45,021
I don't believe it.
She's using the Mel Gibson defense!

251
00:14:45,326 --> 00:14:47,533
I am an perfectly good person.

252
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:53,130
But when I drink, the alcohol makes me say
and do things I normally wouldn't do.

253
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:54,932
Well, that explains it.

254
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:58,133
Do we still press charges?
- Who are we gonna convict, Johnny Walker?

255
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:01,623
Poor woman, she's an victim.
- Yeah, she's an hot victim.

256
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:07,043
My client has agreed to check
herself into rehab immediately.

257
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:11,633
Goodluck, ma'am!
You can beat your alcoholism!

258
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:14,803
PARK COUNTY DRUG & ALCOHOL
REHABILITATION CENTER

259
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:23,173
Alcohol is a crush,
wich we use to medicate ourselfs.

260
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:26,451
to, to cover up emotional bagage from our past.

261
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:30,040
Was there ever an history of sexual
abuse in your family?

262
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:35,052
No, but my uncle used to ask me and my
twin sister to kiss and he'd take pictures.

263
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:37,951
Nice...

264
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,103
Congratulations, Miss Stevenson.

265
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,600
All  better now!

266
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:57,960
Ike!
- Miss Stevensen.

267
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:02,540
Ike, we have to get out of here.
They never let us be together.

268
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:07,122
I think we should go to Milan.
Like we always talked about.

269
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:09,912
Milan...

270
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:13,052
Get your things together!
We don't have much time.

271
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,272
Ike, are you okay?

272
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:22,260
Ike?

273
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,401
You sure your not lying, Foley?

274
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:36,300
No, really! I shot both of them,
they werent even doing nothing!

275
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,703
Help! Please, I need your help!

276
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:41,672
That teacher, Miss Stevenson,
she, she left town with my son!

277
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:43,962
I got a note saying they're going to Milan!

278
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,332
You're kidding!
- No, it's true!

279
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:49,573
Damnit, where were all these
sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!

280
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:51,291
This is serious!

281
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:55,600
Yeah, boys going to Milan with a beautiful
older woman. Quick! Call the FBI!

282
00:16:57,455 --> 00:17:01,020
Are you going to do nothing?!
- All right all right, we'll make a report.

283
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:02,351
Jesus...

284
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:07,752
There you are. What are you doing?
You giving up, brah?!

285
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:10,200
Dude, my brother's in Milan.
There's nothing I can do.

286
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,913
No, they haven't left yet.
Their flight is tomorrow morning.

287
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:16,702
How do you know that?
- I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.

288
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:18,802
Who's Beth?
- Beth is my bitch.

289
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,592
I put a whole crew together, brah.

290
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:23,990
I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut
no matter what it takes! Are you in?!

291
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:30,210
<i>I got some badass guys to help me.</i>

292
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,340
<i>I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.</i>

293
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:37,262
<i>You think you got away
with not having a hall pass?</i>

294
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:40,670
<i>You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!</i>

295
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:44,683
<i>I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!</i>

296
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:47,710
<i>Think you can get away with
not having a hall pass? Think again!</i>

297
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,201
How was that, Butters?

298
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,302
That was pretty good.

299
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:54,230
Can we get going now, please?!

300
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:56,580
Yep. We're all done with
the video, let's move out!

301
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:03,571
Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?

302
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:06,220
I love TV. Yaaay!

303
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:09,670
But what about me?
I want to talk.

304
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:15,931
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive!
I want her taken down fast and clean!

305
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:19,703
She ran away, now she
got to deal with the Dawg, huh?

306
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:24,500
Beth found out they have a room at
the Airport Hilton. We need to search it.

307
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,841
Here's the hotel!
Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!

308
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:32,313
All right, let's go! Move out!

309
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,820
Hey! You can't leave your car there!
- It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!

310
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:38,832
Keep separation!
Leeroy, check out our twenty!

311
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:40,890
Can I help you?
- You seen this woman, brah?

312
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:42,072
She's staying here!

313
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:46,881
Who are you?
- I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!

314
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:49,642
I think you should leave
before I call the police!

315
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:51,393
Beth! Bear-mace that guy!

316
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:54,892
Let's check out the rooms!
Leeroy and Kyle go that way!

317
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,100
Beth, you come with me!

318
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,550
We need police here, right away!

319
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:02,440
Y es?

320
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:04,533
I'm looking for this teacher!
Is she in your room, brah?!

321
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:07,821
Do you mind keepin' it down?
- Keep your mouth shut, brah!

322
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:14,591
Oh no! Ike!
They're on to us!

323
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:16,380
Oh no!

324
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,890
Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!

325
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:20,921
What have we got? What have we got?!
- Who called 911?!

326
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:22,223
They went that way.

327
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,091
Look out! They have bear mace!

328
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:28,203
Open up!
I'm with the Dawg!

329
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:29,742
Oh crap!

330
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:31,473
You freeze right there!

331
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,652
Come on, darling!

332
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,253
Hey!

333
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,801
I've got 'em, dawg!
Fifth floor!

334
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,330
Praise Christ! Let's go!

335
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:43,801
Ike, run!

336
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:48,470
Beth!
Bear mace that guy! And that guy!

337
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:57,193
Freeze, bitch!
- Freeze!

338
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,932
Hands up! Hands up!
- Don't move! Don't move!

339
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:01,722
It's all right!
There's been a misunderstanding!

340
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,201
I'm a hall monitor.

341
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:07,913
This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway
infraction by skipping off to Milan.

342
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,380
Hey, that is the teacher we
just got the report about.

343
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:14,083
All right, Miss Stevenson,
you got nowhere to go!

344
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:17,983
Why couldn't you just leave us alone?
All we wanted was to love.

345
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:21,100
Get down! We can do this the easy way,
or we can do it Dawg-style!

346
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:25,200
She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh?

347
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:27,053
It's all over, Ike.

348
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:31,553
Milan, the house in Tuscany.
They'll never let us be together!

349
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:33,701
We have to go with the backup plan.

350
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:41,223
Now hold on, don't do anything foolish!
We can talk about this!

351
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:47,211
You can't accept our love?
So then we can only be together in eternity.

352
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,513
No!
Ike, don't do it!

353
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,131
I don deser futty bad man.

354
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:57,572
Ike, please. I know your first love seems
like the only love, but trust me, it's not.

355
00:20:57,745 --> 00:20:59,872
You have so much life ahead of you.

356
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:04,743
You who don't believe i
true love don't understand.

357
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:06,871
Ike, you need to have a life.

358
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:10,520
Have fun.
Then ruin it by having a serious relationship.

359
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:14,282
I'm afraid you're too late.

360
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:17,200
Are you ready, my love?
Here we go!

361
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:20,361
One, two, three, aaaahhh!

362
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:22,562
Ike?

363
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:26,980
Yaaaay!

364
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:28,483
Ike!

365
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:32,490
Well, looks like once again,
the Dawg has prevailed.

366
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:35,441
I hope you've learned, kids,
that if you don't go with Christ

367
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:38,111
you could end up just like that
splattered bitch down on the pavement.

368
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:40,463
Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.

369
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:43,190
That's cool.
I'm done making my video anyways.
