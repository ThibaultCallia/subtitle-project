1
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:40,125
You guys, you guys!

2
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,586
Chef is going away.

3
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:45,339
Going away?
For how long?

4
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:47,210
Forever.

5
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:49,738
I'm sorry boys.

6
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:54,279
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a
group called the Super Adventure Club.

7
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:55,737
Wow!

8
00:00:55,821 --> 00:01:01,146
Chef? What kind of questions do you think
adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!

9
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:02,598
What's the meaning of life?

10
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:04,126
Why are we here?

11
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:06,666
I hope you're making the right choice.

12
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:08,708
I'm gonna miss him.

13
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:12,819
I'm gonna miss Chef and
I... and I don't know how to tell him!

14
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,027
Dude, how are we gonna go on?

15
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,663
Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend.

16
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:20,087
And we will all miss you, Chef,

17
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:24,795
but we know you must do
what your heart tells you.

18
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:28,090
Good-bye!

19
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:29,675
Good-bye, Chef!

20
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:32,141
Have a great time with
the Super Adventure Club!

21
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:33,580
Good-bye!

22
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:38,183
See you later!

23
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:49,069
And now, Part Two of "Life Without Chef".

24
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:52,467
Draw two card, fatass.

25
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:54,717
Reverse to you, Jew.

26
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,292
I'll get it.

27
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:00,792
Hello there, children!

28
00:02:00,848 --> 00:02:03,459
He's back!

29
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:08,371
Chef! I can't believe you're back!

30
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:09,899
Well, it's true.

31
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,246
But are you back for good?

32
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:12,593
That's right.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,680
Hey eveybody!
Chef's back!

34
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:28,732
Wow! It seems like you had a great time
with the Super Adventure Club, Chef.

35
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,861
They sound like really interesting people.

36
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:31,695
Yeah!

37
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:33,159
But now that you're back here

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,660
does that mean that you're not
in the Super Adventure Club anymore?

39
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:37,841
No, no!

40
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,543
So have you decided you can still
belong to the Super Adventure Club

41
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,877
but live here in South Park again?

42
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:45,125
That's right.

43
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:48,314
Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club
was just what you needed, Chef.

44
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:51,910
You must be feeling very happy that you
found a club to belong to with new friends,

45
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:54,411
but that you can also live here
in South Park with all your old friends

46
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,470
whom you care for deeply.

47
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:58,036
Right?
- That's right.

48
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,303
Randy!

49
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,313
Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with
me until you buy another house.

50
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:08,440
Thank you. Jimbo.

51
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:12,266
Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would
like a little time to get moved back in.

52
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,919
That's right! Thank you.
Good-bye, everybody.

53
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:20,960
Great to have you back. Bye-bye.
Seeya Chef. See you later. Bye.

54
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:23,648
Well, I- guess we'll see you
in school tomorrow, Chef.

55
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,746
You bet!
Good-bye.

56
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,302
Children!

57
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:31,761
Right.
Uh, seeya.

58
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,264
Uh, guys?

59
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:38,764
Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?

60
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,968
Well, look. he said he's happier now.

61
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:45,519
Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.

62
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,348
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super
Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.

63
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,542
Yeah, but whatever,
I'm just glad he's back for good.

64
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:51,834
Yeah, me too.

65
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:56,682
It's really weird what he said.
I don't know, it kind of confused me.

66
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,057
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to
have Chef's lunch food again.

67
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:03,120
Yeah. I hope he makes his
Salisbury steak with buttered noodles!

68
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:04,554
You guys, you guys.

69
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,152
What?

70
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:06,749
Something's wrong with Chef.

71
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,251
He's saying some really weird stuff.

72
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,638
Like what?

73
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:14,560
I think...
I think he wants to have sex with me.

74
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:15,490
What?!

75
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,754
I gotta... I gotta go.

76
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:19,657
Weirdo.

77
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,505
Hello there, children!

78
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:23,557
Hey, Chef!

79
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,350
How's it goin'?
- Good.

80
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:29,580
Well, how about I meet you boys
after work and we make love?

81
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:32,846
Excuse me?

82
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,499
Come on, children!
You're my sexual fantasy.

83
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,388
Let's all make sweeet love.

84
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,200
Chef?

85
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,436
A-are you okay?

86
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:47,873
I want to stick my balls
inside your rectum, Kyle.

87
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:51,189
Dude, what are you saying?

88
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:55,065
I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.

89
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,148
What?!

90
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,408
Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis.

91
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:07,798
I need to ask you all some difficult
questions about your school cafeteria chef.

92
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,229
This doesn't make any sense!

93
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:15,734
We have some information that all this time
Chef has been and still is a pedophile.

94
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:17,444
No, he's not.

95
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,095
Uh huh.

96
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:20,859
No, he's not.

97
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:22,786
Yeah, yeah he is so.

98
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:24,327
What's a pedophile?

99
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:27,591
Now, we need some tesimony
in order to arrest Chef.

100
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:31,235
So I'm gonna use this doll to
ask you kids a few questions.

101
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:35,096
Did Chef ever touch any of you... here?

102
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,255
No!

103
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:38,215
Okay, did he touch you here?

104
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:39,536
No!

105
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,106
Did he ever do this?

106
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:44,314
How about this?

107
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:47,008
My Uncle Bud did that to me once!

108
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:50,584
Did Chef ever try one of these on for size?

109
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:52,876
Goddamnit, Chef isn't like that!

110
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,857
Something funny is going on around here!

111
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:58,709
Young man, will you please pay attention!
This is very important stuff!

112
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:13,083
Hello there, children!

113
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,234
Chef, the police are asking
questions about you!

114
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:17,500
Oh really?

115
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,487
Well, let's all go home and make love.

116
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,926
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!

117
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:26,509
Kenny, how would you like
to sodomize my black ass?

118
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:27,884
Chef, Chef!

119
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,662
You need to get out of here
before you get arrested, all right?!

120
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:33,641
I specializes in your asshole, Kyle.

121
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,237
Man, I can't believe all this time,
Chef just wanted us for sex.

122
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:46,158
He didn't want us for sex, fatass!
Something is making him say those things

123
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:47,015
Like what?

124
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,234
Something must have happened
to Chef while he was gone.

125
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:52,567
Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck
in some quantum time vortex.

126
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,622
Well look, he spent the last three
months with that adventurers' club.

127
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,026
Maybe they know what happened to him.

128
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:59,338
Yeah! I think...

129
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:01,964
Yeah!
- Yeah!

130
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,992
All right, come on guys!

131
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:15,053
Hey you guys, you know what
they call a Jewish woman's boobs?

132
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,706
Jewbs.

133
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,656
May I help you?

134
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,856
Ah, hi, can we speak to
the head guy or something?

135
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,418
Right this way.

136
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,599
Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be
quite a trek and so we'll need to have a-

137
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:38,821
Excuse me, sir.

138
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,155
These boys wanted to speak with you.

139
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,966
Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads!

140
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,677
I'm Head Adventurer
William P. Connolly, Esquire!

141
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,681
Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!

142
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,973
Tally ho!
- Indeed!

143
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,930
Ah, hi. Our friend joined
your club a while back

144
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,285
and now he wants to molest kids.

145
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,994
What?

146
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:03,861
Well... well yes, of course!
That's what the Super Adventure Club does!

147
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:04,736
Huh?

148
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,764
We travel the world
and have sex with children!

149
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:09,972
Yes, what else would we do?

150
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,515
Well, we thought you went exploring
and like, hunting and stuff!

151
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,542
No, no, that's the Adventure Club.

152
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,582
We're the Super Adventure Club!

153
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,313
Next week, we'll be heading to
the outer banks of the Amazon,

154
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:24,771
where we will make camp and have
sex with children of the Ugani tribe.

155
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:28,243
Then it's off to the mighty Himalayas,
where we will climb K-2

156
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,215
and molest several
Tibetan children on the east summit.

157
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:32,389
Dude!

158
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,338
I know, but it gets even better!

159
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:38,032
From there we will kayak to the
fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa

160
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:40,361
where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people

161
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:43,612
have children who have never
seen a white man's erect penis.

162
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:45,908
Of course, we're always looking
for kids to have sex with

163
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:47,687
on the plane rides over to these places.

164
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:51,240
So how would you all like to
join the Super Adventure Club!

165
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,060
No!

166
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,119
No?

167
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:55,740
Oh really?

168
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:58,462
Perhaps I should ask you again?

169
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,889
How would you like to join
the Super Adventure Club?

170
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,305
No!

171
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:12,444
Dude, what are you doing?!

172
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:14,552
Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody.

173
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:15,816
Well, so long then.

174
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:17,469
Just what the hell is that thing?!

175
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:19,469
What? What thing?
I don't see anything.

176
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,105
Ha! I knew it!

177
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,997
Knew what?

178
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:24,736
The reason Chef has been saying
those terrible things about us

179
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:28,681
is because he's been brainwashed!
By this fruity little club!

180
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,952
Oh, son of a bitch!

181
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:42,613
Come on, children.
Let's all go home and make love.

182
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:45,421
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef.
It's for your own good.

183
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:48,102
I just like to make love up your butt.

184
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,533
Oh my God!

185
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,477
Mr. Chef, is it?

186
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:52,982
All right, come on.

187
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:58,704
Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland.
What can I do for you today?

188
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:02,482
Hi, our friend has been brainwashed
by some fruity little club.

189
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:04,783
Brainwashed?
- Yeah.

190
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:06,310
He joined the Super Adventure Club

191
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:08,422
and they convinced him having
sex with children was okay

192
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,520
with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.

193
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,159
I thought that club was
for hiking and kayaking.

194
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:16,554
No, that's the Adventure Club.
The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.

195
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:17,610
Oh.

196
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,403
Oh, that's right, yeah.

197
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:22,443
Doctor, do you have- children?

198
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:25,200
Why, yes, I have two young boys.

199
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,745
Have you all been sodomizing your children too?

200
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,698
You say he's never been like this before?

201
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,725
No, Chef has always been super-cool.

202
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:35,924
I'm gonna make love to the children.

203
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,651
He's pretty brainwashed all right.
Worst case I've ever seen.

204
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:40,707
So what can we do?

205
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:44,012
I'm afraid there's no simple answer.
When somebody's brainwashed

206
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:46,665
it can take months, even years,
to reverse the process.

207
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:50,541
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps
this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!

208
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:55,606
Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to
do before it was having sex with children?

209
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,024
Having sex with women.

210
00:10:57,124 --> 00:11:02,015
Then that's it. We'd better get your friend
to the Peppermint Hippo right away.

211
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:08,303
All right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses,
this is two for one, put your hands together!

212
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:09,845
This is Moniqua!

213
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,415
Aw, come on, children.
Let's go home.

214
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:17,169
This isn't working.

215
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:19,755
Well let's... give it some more time, kids.

216
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:23,053
Would you like to daaance?
- No thanks.

217
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:24,804
We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.

218
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,117
Daaance? Anybody wanna daaance?

219
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,117
Come on, bitch! Dance!

220
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:34,423
Up yours, fatty.

221
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:35,951
Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!

222
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,934
All right guys, help me feel it out to them,
we got a featured dancer oming out next.

223
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:42,966
Put your hands together for...
Spantaneous Bootay!

224
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,390
Come on guys, we might as well go.

225
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,166
God-damn!

226
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,388
Chef, we're leaving.

227
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:00,041
No, no, wait. Let him go.

228
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,152
Come here, chubby.

229
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,828
Wait a minute.

230
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:21,939
He's remembering.

231
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:24,069
Children! What have I done?

232
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:26,038
It's okay Chef.
Go on, remember!

233
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:28,066
I'm gonna- I'm gonna-

234
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:30,742
Come on, Chef!
You can do it!

235
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:34,163
I'm goinna make love to you woman,

236
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:37,791
'gonna lay you down by the fiyuh!

237
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,745
Yay!

238
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:42,481
Hey children, everybody!
I'm back!

239
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,796
Great shot, William!
Hit him with another.

240
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:52,004
Chef!

241
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,821
Tally ho, lads! I must say you're starting
to become quite a thorn in my balls.

242
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:04,432
Where's Chef?!
What have you done with him?!

243
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:05,966
He's safe.

244
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:11,202
He's fasting in the Deprivation Room
and being read the Super Adventure Club manual.

245
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,647
We've got to undo the damage you've done.

246
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,262
Look, if you wanna go around the
world molesting kids, that's totally fine.

247
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:18,540
But why do you need Chef?!

248
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:21,220
We don't need him, he needs us!

249
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:25,123
Our club offers hope.
Do you think we go around the world

250
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,871
molesting children just because it
feels really really really really good?!

251
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:34,483
No! Our club has a message! And a secret
that explains the mysteries of life!

252
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:36,135
Oh Jesus, here we go.

253
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:41,172
Very well. I'm now going to tell you
the secret of the Super Adventure Club.

254
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,189
We don't wanna hear it.

255
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:46,574
You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded
by the greatest explorer of all time

256
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,880
William P. Phinehas!

257
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:52,866
Phinehas climbed the highest peaks,
tamed the mightiest rivers.

258
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:57,603
But every time he got somewhere, he realized
that other explorers had beat him to it.

259
00:13:57,617 --> 00:14:02,280
Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that
if he couldn't be the first to discover places

260
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:07,502
he could be the first to have sex with
the native children that inhabited those areas!

261
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:09,409
Phinehas quickly went down in history books

262
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,041
as the first man to have sex
with the Aborigine children at Uluru.

263
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:17,380
and the first explorer to bugger all
the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.

264
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,255
But now the most wonderful part.

265
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:23,783
You see, after having sex with all
those children, Phinehas realized that...

266
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:27,519
molesting all those kids...
had made him immortal.

267
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:29,083
Immortal.

268
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,903
He discovered that children have
things called marlocks in their bodies.

269
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:36,153
And when an adult has sex with a child,
the marlocks implode,

270
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,744
feeding the adult receptive cavity with
energy that causes immortality

271
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,856
so saith the ruler of Bethos.

272
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,961
Phinehas traveled the world,
loving many, many children

273
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,550
and he lived for eternity.

274
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:52,843
Until he was hit by a train in 1892.

275
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,439
Do you realize how retarded that sounds?

276
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:59,825
Is it any more retarded than the idea of God
sending his son to die for our sins?

277
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:03,561
Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting
beneath a tree for twenty years?

278
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:06,227
Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.

279
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:12,259
Well, now that you know our club secrets,
it appears you ... leave us no choice.

280
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,536
I'm afraid we're going to have to...

281
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:17,536
ask you to leave.

282
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,352
We're not leaving without Chef.

283
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,796
If you choose not to leave, then I'm
afraid we're just going to have to...

284
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:32,033
call security and make you leave.

285
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,111
You'll be let out by security and it will be
super-embarassing and everyone here will see!

286
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,667
Okay, you know how like, when you want
people to leave but they won't leave,

287
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:56,265
it's really frustrating?

288
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,242
We're not going anywhere without Chef.

289
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:01,086
Cool people leave before they've
overstayed their welcome.

290
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:07,770
You petulent fools!
You just had to push it, didn't you?

291
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:11,312
You don't realize who you're dealing with here.

292
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,082
Security!

293
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,526
Take these boys to the door.

294
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,943
All right, come on kids.

295
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,263
No! Hey!

296
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:24,061
Haha! Look they're being led
out by security! Haha!

297
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,271
No, you don't understand! They've got
our friend in the Deprivation Room!

298
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:29,852
This is their house
and they don't want you here.

299
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:36,905
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little
club isn't taking our friend!

300
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:40,383
And sex with Eskimo children
requires some special skills.

301
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:43,105
Chef, come on!
- Children!

302
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,246
Get out of here!

303
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:47,499
Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!

304
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,539
Come on, Chef!
- I can't... break these locks.

305
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,025
Here!

306
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:56,937
Run Chef!

307
00:16:57,714 --> 00:16:58,756
What the-?

308
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:02,173
Impossible!
I made them leave!

309
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,381
Get outside!

310
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:05,304
Stop them!

311
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,812
Children! Run!

312
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:12,954
Stop!

313
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,152
We made it!

314
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,871
Don't you remember why you
left South Park in the first place?

315
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:22,551
Chef, come on!

316
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,872
You sought adventure!
And why do people seek adventure?

317
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:30,334
Because their lives have become dull and empty!

318
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:33,832
Yeah, he wanted adventure!
Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap!

319
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,256
Right Chef?

320
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:38,881
Chef?

321
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,617
Don't forget all your training, Chef!

322
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:45,947
Stay with us and your life
will be grand and eternal!

323
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,687
Chef, we love you.

324
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,983
I'm sorry children.

325
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:57,836
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies!

326
00:17:57,906 --> 00:17:58,904
Can't you see that?

327
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:01,449
Get the hell out of here, children!

328
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:06,171
Yes. Looks like our fruity
little club is safe after all.

329
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:13,091
Chef!

330
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,435
Damnit!

331
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:23,060
No!

332
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:27,795
A mountain lion!

333
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,758
We can't lose another member!
Shoot it!

334
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,931
All right, this!

335
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,445
Chef!

336
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:41,272
A grizzly bear!

337
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,511
Oh my God... They killed Chef.

338
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,446
You bastards.

339
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,782
You bastards!

340
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,935
Pity. He would have made
an excellent child molester.

341
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:21,195
Maybe, maybe he's still okay.

342
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:25,658
No, really. They say the last thing
you do before you die is crap your-

343
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:28,862
Oh never mind.

344
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:32,195
Come on, let's go.

345
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,867
We're all here today because Chef has
been such an important part of our lives.

346
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:02,569
A lot of us don't agree with the choices
Chef has made in the past few days.

347
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:07,751
Some of us... feel hurt... and confused
that he seemed to turn his back on us.

348
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,244
But we can't let the events of the last week

349
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:13,161
take away the memories of
how much Chef made us smile.

350
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:17,338
I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly
old guy who always broke into song.

351
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:22,046
I'm gonna remember Chef...
as the guy who gave us advice to live by.

352
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:26,468
So you see, we shouldn't
be mad at Chef for leaving us.

353
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:31,024
We should be mad at that little
fruity club for scrambling his brains.

354
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,094
Yeah.

355
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:35,413
He's right.

356
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:41,206
And in the end,
I know that somewhere out there...

357
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:44,867
there's the good part of Chef...
that's still alive in us all.

358
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,361
Is it working?
Is it working?!

359
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,500
Yes. We've got a pulse!

360
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,055
Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry!

361
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,411
We have done it!
Good! Raise him up!

362
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:14,391
Chef, can you hear me?

363
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,685
Say something.

364
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,607
Hello there, children.

365
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:24,162
How would you like some Salisbury steak?

366
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,407
Yes, go on.

367
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:32,955
And for dessert, how would you children
like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?

368
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:36,622
Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy?

369
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:39,955
No, I mean my balls.

370
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:43,648
Yes, yes!
Hahahahahahaaa!
