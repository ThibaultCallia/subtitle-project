1
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:46,839
Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap.
Hey, where are you guys?

2
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:49,473
We're over here, by the cart.

3
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:51,929
Okay, I'm back.

4
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:53,823
Dude! We've been waiting forever!

5
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,913
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!

6
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:59,361
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't
have diarrhea all the time, fatass!

7
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,881
Hey, I don't need to take
any lip from a frickin' girl!

8
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:04,050
<i>I think Kyle has fake titties, hahaaha.</i>

9
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:05,412
Heheh, totally, heheh.

10
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:08,120
Come on, we have to finish
the quest in Stonehaven.

11
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:10,571
Stan? Staan?

12
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:12,652
Hang on, guys, my dad wants something.

13
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:13,970
Stan?!

14
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:15,392
What?!

15
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:17,211
You've been on your computere all weekend.

16
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:19,502
Shouldn't you go out
and socialize with your friends?

17
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:21,432
I am socializing, r-tard.

18
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,603
I'm logged on to an MMORPG
with people from all over the world

19
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:27,633
and getting xp with my party using teamspeak!

20
00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:31,973
I'm not a r-tard.

21
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:36,121
All right, sorry guys.
So where to now?

22
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:37,800
See where I am?
It's this way.

23
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:39,373
Yeah, come on, let's go!

24
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:44,991
I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!

25
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:47,071
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.

26
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,271
Yeah, it's bullcrap.

27
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,851
I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.

28
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:52,842
Oh crap!
It's that guy again!

29
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,042
Who is this?

30
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:57,962
This is the guy that kept killing
us after you went to bed!

31
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:59,792
Get out of here, asshole!

32
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,910
He's a way higher level than us.
It isn't fair.

33
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:05,092
It's all right.
He can't kill us unless we agree to duel.

34
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:10,210
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!

35
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:12,232
You bastard!

36
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:20,163
Don't you have better things to do
than going online killing people?!

37
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,600
No! I don't want them to start
over at the graveyard!

38
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:24,942
No!

39
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:29,362
That son of a bitch!

40
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,880
Who is that guy?

41
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,562
Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.

42
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:44,052
World of Warcraft support line.

43
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:46,013
Yeah, we bought your game
and played it online

44
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,721
but every time we log in, some other
player comes in and kills us!

45
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,490
O..ohhh that shouldn't happen.

46
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,311
We designed the game so
that players have to agree

47
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,193
to a duel before they can kill each other.

48
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,693
Yeah, well this guy does it anyway!

49
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:57,292
He's a Goddamned butthole!

50
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:58,610
Really?
That's odd.

51
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,383
More people calling in about
their characters getting killed.

52
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:02,161
Oh no.

53
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:06,372
Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for
that player and ban him from the network.

54
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:08,602
Better tell the guys upstairs.

55
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:12,200
Fellow board members, we have a problem.

56
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:17,130
Somebody in the World of Warcraft
is ignoring the World's rules...

57
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:20,293
and is going around killing innocent players.

58
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:22,953
Why kill innocent players?

59
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:25,550
The game is about finishing quests.

60
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,631
We've got to delete him from the servers.

61
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,060
We can't.

62
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:32,540
Whoever this player is, he has played
World of Warcraft so much

63
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,782
that he has reached a level
we thought unreachable.

64
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:38,502
He's actually able to kill our admins.

65
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,192
And he grows stronger every day.

66
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,523
Jesus...

67
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,102
I've gotta get home!

68
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:46,603
My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!

69
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:50,991
Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.

70
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:54,062
No... no.

71
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,652
They just started playing!

72
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:00,621
What kind of person would do this?

73
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,032
Only  one kind.

74
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:06,720
Whoever this player is, he has played World
of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day

75
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,031
for the past year and a half.

76
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:13,130
Gentlemen, we are dealing
with someone here who...

77
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,962
has absolutely no life.

78
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:21,750
How do you kill that which has no life?

79
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,763
Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?

80
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,442
Not now, Nelson.
I just joined a big party of night elves

81
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:34,280
and we're gonna explore
the Tower of Azora together.

82
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,800
Is that a computer game?

83
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,663
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG.

84
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:40,320
These are real people I'm playing with.

85
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:43,960
See, I'm a hunter, level 2.
I can chat with all these other people.

86
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,823
I can even wave to this guy, see?

87
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,350
"Hello."

88
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:50,433
In the outside world,
I'm a simple geologist,

89
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:55,273
but in here... I am Valkorn,
Defender of the Alliance.

90
00:04:55,278 --> 00:05:00,192
I've braved the Fargo deep mine to feed
it the bloodfish at Jaro d's Landing.

91
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:07,231
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you.

92
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,661
What?

93
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,372
Why?
Why?!

94
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,292
My friends...

95
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:16,322
As you all know, some giant butthole
keeps logging onto Warcraft

96
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:18,182
and killing all our characters.

97
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:21,183
The past four nights we've tried
to play, he shows up and kills us!

98
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:23,753
He killed my character right
in the middle of a quest!

99
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:25,021
Mine too!

100
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,272
We've learned that the four
of us can't fight him alone.

101
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:31,310
But, if we all log in together,
we might have a chance.

102
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:32,420
Hey yeah!

103
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:34,930
We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!

104
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:35,973
Are you guys dumb?

105
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:38,681
We can't beat him, even with all of us.
It's a waste of time.

106
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,190
Dude, we have to try.

107
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:41,840
I've got better things to do.

108
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:45,070
Clyde, Clyde! If you had a chance
right now to go back in time

109
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,600
and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?

110
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:52,143
I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because
I think he was awesome, but you would, right?

111
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:53,900
I'm just gonna stop playing.

112
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,980
When Hitler rose to power there were
a lot of people who just stopped playing.

113
00:05:57,048 --> 00:05:58,551
You know who those people were?

114
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:01,300
The French!
Are you French, Clyde?

115
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:02,112
No.

116
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:04,500
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?

117
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,960
All right all right, I'll do it!

118
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:07,650
So what's the p-plan?

119
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:11,062
All  right, you all login from
your computers at precisely 7:30.

120
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:13,920
We will meet here, on the plains
of the elven forest near Westfall.

121
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:16,170
My  friends, to victory!

122
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,633
To victory!

123
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:20,222
I don't play World of Warcraft.

124
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,313
Butters, you said you were
on your computer all the time!

125
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:27,151
Yeah, but I'm playing
Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

126
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:31,060
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft,
install it on your computer

127
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,861
and join the online sensation
before we all murder you.

128
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,943
O-oh, o-oh, a-alright.
All right then.

129
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,122
All right, you guys, this is it!

130
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,342
When the attack begins,
all warriors click on defensive stance.

131
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,482
Everyone else, wait for Craig
to cast his intellect buff.

132
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:53,133
Okay.

133
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,043
Got it.

134
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:55,440
The battle is sure to be long

135
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,770
so make sure you all have your special
abilities macroed to your keyboards.

136
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,749
All right, Eric.
You can c-c-count on us.

137
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:02,933
Timmy!

138
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,173
This shall be a day for all to remember!

139
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:07,420
Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!

140
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,530
From with-
- Hey fellas!

141
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,873
Boy, this is neato, huh?

142
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:17,111
Butters?
What the hell are you doing?

143
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:19,840
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.

144
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:22,672
You can't be the dwarf character,
Butters, I'm the dwarf.

145
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,693
Well, there's only like four
races to choose from-

146
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:27,193
So pick another one!
I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole!

147
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,921
Log out, create a new character
and log back in!

148
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,973
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure
a lot more 'n this stuff.

149
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,470
Come on, let's do this!

150
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,751
Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.

151
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,952
Then let's move out!

152
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,613
Look! There he is!

153
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:57,863
Everyone hold!

154
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,233
He's targeting us.

155
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:02,833
Prepare to charge!

156
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:05,453
Scroll over him with your mouse cursors!

157
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,512
And... Right-click!

158
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:12,762
What the?

159
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:15,600
Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions!

160
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:27,521
I'm burning!
Oh Jesus I'm burning!

161
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:32,631
Kenny's down.
K-k-kenny is down.

162
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:37,230
I have poop on my pants.

163
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:39,650
Ike, look out!

164
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:41,523
Kyle...

165
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:46,021
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!

166
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:48,842
Hit him now, Clyde!

167
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:51,372
Clyde?
Clyde!

168
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:53,670
Clyde! Come on, you guys, move!

169
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,561
Goddamnit we lost Clyde!

170
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,760
Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys?

171
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:02,050
Dad?

172
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,821
Yeah, I'm playing from the office.

173
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:06,593
Dad, get off our teamspeak line!

174
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:09,560
That's it, I'm dead!

175
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:13,221
That's it, screw this game!

176
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:16,970
No, leave me alone,
don't do... that, dugh

177
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:23,013
God-fucking-damnit!

178
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:29,641
Oh Jesus...

179
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,232
Oh God no...

180
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:32,791
What?

181
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:37,433
He just finished killing every single
player in the Arathi Highlands.

182
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,402
How many people's characters were in there?

183
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,152
Over five thousand.

184
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:46,011
There are over seven million people
who log on to World of Warcraft!

185
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:49,060
Are you telling me all those people's
characters are going to die

186
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,711
and there's nothing we can do to save them?

187
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:52,842
Yes.

188
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:55,642
And it won't be long before everyone
gets really really frustrated

189
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:57,483
and stops playing altogether.

190
00:09:57,577 --> 00:10:04,350
Gentlemen, this could very well lead to
the end of the World... of Warcraft.

191
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:07,240
No! Noooo!

192
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:18,492
What the hell are you guys doing?

193
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:20,992
Don't tell me you all quit playing
World of Warcraft too?!

194
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:23,560
Dude, we're done.
We're sick of getting killed all the time.

195
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:27,792
Guys, when things look bad, you can't
just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.

196
00:10:27,856 --> 00:10:31,422
We don't have a choice, dude.
That guy killed our characters 14 times.

197
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,132
I have a solution, you guys.

198
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,081
That guy can kill us so easily
because he's a super-high level, right?

199
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:38,593
What if we were super-high level too?

200
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:42,252
We can't get to a higher level because
that dude doesn't let us finish quests!

201
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:46,700
That's why we just need to log in
and stay in the forest, killing boars.

202
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:47,453
Boars?

203
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:50,601
There's lots of computer-generated boars
in Warcraft that die with just one blow.

204
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:53,112
Dude, boars are only worth
two experience points apiece.

205
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:55,942
Do you know how many we would
have to kill to get up 30 levels?

206
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:57,311
Yes.

207
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,593
Sixty-five million three hundred and forty
thousand two hundred and eighty five.

208
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:03,580
Which should take us seven weeks, five days,
thirteen hours and twenty minutes

209
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:05,312
giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep.

210
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,642
What do you say, guys?

211
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:10,583
You can just, you can just hang outside
in the sun all day tossin' a ball around

212
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:13,060
or you can sit at your computer
and do somethin' that matters.

213
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:32,432
<i>Live to win, till you die,
till the light dies in your eyes!</i>

214
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:40,890
<i>Live to win, take it all,
just keep fighting till you fall!</i>

215
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:48,201
<i>Day by day, kickin' all the way
I'm not cavin' in</i>

216
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:53,272
<i>Let another round begin,
live to win</i>

217
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,140
<i>Yeah!</i>

218
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,913
<i>Live!</i>

219
00:11:56,918 --> 00:11:58,922
<i>Yeah!</i>

220
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,040
<i>Win!</i>

221
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,711
Sir, you'd better have a look at this!

222
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,683
Four of our subscribers...
They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks.

223
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:11,072
My God... they must have no lives at all.

224
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,472
A hope?
- A chance.

225
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:21,733
<i>Live to win, till you die,
till the light dies in your eyes</i>

226
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,342
My mouse-clicking finger hurts.
- Come on, Kyle! You can do it!

227
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:30,063
<i>just keep fighting 'till you fall</i>

228
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:37,262
<i>Day by day, kickin' all the way,
I'm not cavin' in</i>

229
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:43,980
<i>Let  another round begin,
live to win</i>

230
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:03,582
The admins tell us they are four players
from a small town in Colorado.

231
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:06,543
Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?

232
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:09,603
We ran the numbers,
even with their amazing rise in levels

233
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:12,082
they have a 90% mortality probability.

234
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:14,003
They'd be walking in a slaughter!

235
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:17,430
There has to be someway we can help them.

236
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:21,690
What about... the Sword of a Thousand Truths?

237
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:25,241
Quiet, Thomas!
We aren't even to speak of that sword!

238
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:28,533
But maybe these new players are
the ones the prophecy foretold of.

239
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:29,862
It is not an option!

240
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:31,651
What is this sword?

241
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:34,781
Long ago,
when the World of Warcraft was created

242
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:38,300
one of the programmers put a sword,
called the Sword of a Thousand Truths

243
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:40,230
into the game inventory.

244
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:42,842
Apparently it could cause
120 damage per second,

245
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:47,121
with an instant mana burn and an
enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.

246
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:51,432
But the sword was considered to be
too powerful for anyone to possess.

247
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:56,251
So it was removed from the game
and stored on a one-gig flash drive.

248
00:13:56,385 --> 00:14:00,130
But it was foretold that one day
players who could wield the sword

249
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:02,050
might reveal themselves.

250
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,940
Who foretold this prophecy?

251
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:06,643
Soltzman. He's an accountant.

252
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:23,393
Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.

253
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:28,240
We must get this sword to the ones
who have proven they have no life.

254
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:32,213
Let's just hope to Christ they don't
start the battle before we can reach them.

255
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,062
All right, you guys.
The Moment of Truth is here.

256
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:40,083
It is time for our final battle.
Everyone, log in!

257
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:41,543
I'm in.

258
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:43,900
Me too.
- Me too.

259
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:47,362
Everyonen equip healing potions to
the hotbar if you haven't already.

260
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:51,003
Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance
to raise our intelligence.

261
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,440
Hang on, I'm chaining my
fire spells for max range.

262
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:54,561
N ice.

263
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:57,062
Stan, what enchantment does
your Cloak of the Tiger have?

264
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,593
Plus 15 agility.

265
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:01,663
Give the cloak to Kenny.
He needs the agility boost for bow attacks.

266
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:02,461
Okay.

267
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:06,353
Hold on, this fight could last more than
twelve hours. What if we run out of food?

268
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,290
Don't worry, I have that covered.

269
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:09,081
Mom?

270
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:10,080
Yes, hon?

271
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:11,473
More Hot Pockets!

272
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,883
Right away, hon.

273
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,571
That's übercool.

274
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:15,870
All right, everyone ready?

275
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,033
Ready.
- Ready.

276
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,123
Let's go get him!

277
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:30,673
Wait, I think I see him.
Yeah, yeah he's here in Goldshire.

278
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:34,321
Okay, everyone open your uplifts
and autolocate to Stan.

279
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:36,871
What's the autolocate macro?

280
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,552
Command zero.

281
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,843
Okay, right behind Stan.

282
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,180
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura.

283
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:46,031
At that moment,
I will use intimidating shout.

284
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,702
Okay, he sees us.

285
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:51,801
He's targeted us.

286
00:15:51,857 --> 00:15:53,941
Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.

287
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,843
Casting... there's an 8-second cast time.

288
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:58,722
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?

289
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,843
No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.

290
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:02,043
Christ.

291
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,212
Cast summon again.

292
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:06,271
Everyone target the scorpions.

293
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:28,623
Yes?

294
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:33,270
We are looking for a great knight
by the name of lovestospooge.

295
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,972
That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.

296
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,140
Where is he?!

297
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:38,093
Who are you?

298
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:39,893
Sir, we don't have time!

299
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,451
We just heard from our admins that
your son's party is already in battle!

300
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:48,062
Unless they have this sword,
your son's character is going to die!

301
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:52,010
Nn-Oh my God!

302
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,051
Kyle! Fire spell!

303
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,112
Kyle?

304
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:04,470
Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?

305
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,320
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel!
It's aaaah!

306
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:08,991
Oh Jesus, he's got it bad!

307
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:11,432
Wait, we need Ben-Gay.

308
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:17,661
Hurry, dude!

309
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:19,420
I'm going as fast as I can!

310
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:20,740
Kyle, you have to keep playing.

311
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,903
I can't.
Just leave me behind.

312
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:25,243
We can't do this without you!
Now come on!

313
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,460
Stan?! Stan!

314
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,193
Sharon, where is Stan?!

315
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:33,640
I don't know. He took his computer
somewhere to play that stupid online game.

316
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:34,843
Stupid?

317
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:35,573
Where?!

318
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:37,012
I don't know.

319
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:40,023
Sharon, his character is going
to die if we don't get to him!

320
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:40,921
So what?

321
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:42,621
So what?!

322
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:46,383
We're too late.
Without the sword the players will fail.

323
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:49,591
If we could get to a computer,
we could sign on to the World of Warcraft

324
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:51,893
and give the boys the sword online.

325
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:54,213
I don't have a World of Warcraft account.
Do you?

326
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,530
No, I have a life.

327
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:58,612
Give me the sword.

328
00:17:58,697 --> 00:17:59,411
You?

329
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,943
I have a Warcraft character.

330
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:03,921
I'm a newb, but I can log on
and get the sword to Stan online.

331
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:07,173
We can't trust the Sword of a
Thousand Truths to a newb!

332
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,103
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice!

333
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:11,031
Give me the sword.

334
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,782
Come on, we've got to get
to a computer that works!

335
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:22,032
Where's your car?

336
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,302
We took a cab here!

337
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,762
Damnit, mine's in the shop!

338
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,110
Uh hey!
Eh help! Stop!

339
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:30,162
Please, it's an emergency!

340
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,762
Come on!

341
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:37,942
Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over
and use your computer!

342
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,493
No, I d- I need to play World of Warcraft!

343
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:41,573
Nelson!

344
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:51,102
All right,
major stone shield potions should be...

345
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:55,350
Oh God, I'm going to have
diarrhea again. Ohhh-... Duuuh-...

346
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:58,072
You can't go to the bathroom,
you're stacking sunder armor!

347
00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,911
It's okay.

348
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:01,683
Mom?
Bathroom!

349
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:02,682
What hon?

350
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,183
Bathroom!
Bathroom!

351
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:13,563
Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he?

352
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:18,551
All  right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the
mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.

353
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,790
World of Warcraft! I need to play!

354
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:27,642
Our demo is set up right over by the-

355
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:32,973
Got to... sign in... character name...

356
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,102
All right, I'm in!

357
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:36,263
Dude, I'm almost dead.

358
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:38,011
Kyle, cast arcane missile!

359
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:39,953
I'm out of mana, I told you.

360
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,100
I've gotta heal.

361
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:44,553
Staaan!

362
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:47,313
Dad?
Not now!

363
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:51,601
Stan!
I've been sent here to bring you this.

364
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:54,111
This sword can completely drain his mana.

365
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:55,481
Dad, how did you get that?

366
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,503
No time!
Just take it!

367
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:59,080
Here!

368
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:04,453
How, how do you hand something
from one player to another?

369
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:07,913
Bring up your inventory screen, Control-I.
- Okay.

370
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:10,531
Stan, what the hell are you doing?!

371
00:20:11,318 --> 00:20:13,001
I got it!

372
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:14,110
Dad!

373
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:15,913
Stan...

374
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:17,570
Dad, no!

375
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,573
You killed my father.

376
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:27,232
His shield and armor spells are down!

377
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,443
Attack!

378
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,500
Looks like you're about to get pwned.

379
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:50,550
Dad? Dad?

380
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:52,691
Stan...

381
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:56,251
I've never been able
to say this before, but...

382
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:58,281
I love you, son.

383
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,253
I know you do, Dad.

384
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:08,510
They did it!

385
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,731
Our world is saved!

386
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:14,330
They did it!
They killed him!

387
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,071
They did it!
- They killed him!

388
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:18,060
We can come out!

389
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:20,470
Yes!
- We did it!

390
00:21:21,117 --> 00:21:23,500
All right, yay.
- Woohoo! Oh man!

391
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:26,473
We did it you guys.
We're totally heroes.

392
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,460
That was such über pwnage.

393
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:32,102
I can't believe it's all over.
What do we do now?

394
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:37,051
What do you mean?
Now we can finally play the game.

395
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:38,500
Oh yeah.

396
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:41,720
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast
to your hotbar.

397
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,773
Stan, check your fury talents
to boost your shots.

398
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:45,803
Got it.
