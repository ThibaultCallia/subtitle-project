1
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:40,760
Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn!

2
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:43,518
Oh, for the love of God,
how much longer?!

3
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:46,094
There you are, Eric.
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:48,282
I'm waiting for the new
Nintendo Wii to come out.

5
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:50,396
When does it come out?

6
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:51,380
Three weeks.

7
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,928
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!

8
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,380
It's time for school.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,352
No Mom, you don't understand!

10
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:59,912
I've been waiting for this
thing to come out for months.

11
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:03,116
And now, every day
time is slowing down.

12
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:07,753
It's like... waiting for
Christmas... times a thousand.

13
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,884
Eric, you're just going
to have to be patient.

14
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:13,411
Noo!! Nooo!!

15
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,112
Principal Victoria, it is wrong!

16
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:19,681
It is wrong and I simply will not do it!

17
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:24,064
I care about my students, and I
will not fill their heads with lies!

18
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:27,327
I am NOT teaching
evolution in my class!!

19
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:30,848
Mrs. Garrison, evolution
is in the school curriculum.

20
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:32,102
We have to teach it.

21
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:36,958
Evolution is a theory! A hare-breained
theory that says I'm a monkey!

22
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,914
I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!

23
00:01:40,957 --> 00:01:47,045
M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution
has been pretty much uhhh... proven.

24
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:49,130
I warn you, Principal Victoria!

25
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,173
Those students are not
prepared to hear this stuff!

26
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:54,780
Our students want to
learn, Mrs. Garrison,

27
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,152
and they're mature
enough to handle anything.

28
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:02,745
How long until Nintendo
Wii comes out now?!

29
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:04,121
It's still three weeks.

30
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,351
Oh God...

31
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:07,410
Okay, how long now?

32
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,220
Will you shut up already?!

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,287
All right kids, it is now my job to
teach you the theory of evolution.

34
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:16,918
Oh boy!

35
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:20,951
Now I, for one, think evolution
is a bnuch of BULLCRAP.

36
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:23,983
But I've been told I
have to teach it anyway.

37
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:27,605
It was thought up by Charles Darwin
and it goes something like this:

38
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,616
In the beginning we were all fish. Okay?

39
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,349
Swimming around in the water.

40
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,871
And then one day a couple
of fish had a retard baby,

41
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,986
and the retard baby was
different, so it got to live.

42
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:43,789
So Retard Fish goes on to make more
retard babies, and then one day,

43
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:49,035
a retard baby fish crawled out of the
ocean with its mutant fish hands...

44
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,400
and it had buttsex with a squirrel
or something and made this.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,874
retard frog squirrel, and then that
had a retard baby which was a...

46
00:02:57,874 --> 00:02:59,770
monkey fish-frog...

47
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:03,987
And then this monkey fish-frog
had buttsex with that monkey, and..

48
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:07,757
that monkey had a mutant retard baby
that screwed another monkey and...

49
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,417
that made you!

50
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,213
So there you go!

51
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:16,229
You're the retarded offspring of five
monkeys havin' buttsex with a fish-squirrel!

52
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,092
Congratulations!

53
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:22,846
HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!

54
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:26,750
Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.

55
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,289
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!

56
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,277
Look, kid, for the fortieth time,

57
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:39,973
pacing in front of the store isn't
gonna make the Wii come any faster.

58
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,912
Eric, you're coming home right now!

59
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:45,552
Can't I just stay and... look
at the sign a little longer?

60
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:49,233
It's almost bedtime. If you
sleep then time'll go by faster.

61
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,315
Oh God!

62
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:41,110
Agh! That does it!! I am
not waiting three weeks!!

63
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,997
You guys! You guys!
You guys, you gotta help me.

64
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:46,323
Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.

65
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:47,690
I can't take it anymore, you guys.

66
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,413
The wait for Nintendo Wii
is literally killing me.

67
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:53,005
Well there's nothing you can do,
so you just have to be patient.

68
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:55,736
No. There is something I can do.

69
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:56,633
(What?)

70
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:59,231
All right, listen: you
know how in space movies

71
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:02,580
they put astronauts in suspender animation
so that their trip seems really short, right?

72
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,291
I think I figured out how to do it.

73
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,099
Do what?

74
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:06,301
Freeze myself.

75
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:08,254
If I freeze myself, then in three weeks,

76
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:11,088
when Nintendo Wii comes out,
you guys can unfreeze me.

77
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:13,482
The wait will seem instantaneous to me.

78
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:15,182
No.

79
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,578
It's simple science, Kyle.

80
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:17,974
You'll die, retard!

81
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:19,618
I'll die waiting for
the Wii to come out!!

82
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,146
Don't you see this is my only chance!!

83
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,155
Dude, no way.

84
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,053
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm
not going to help kill you.

85
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,245
I thought you were my
friends! I guess I was wrong!

86
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,576
After everthing we've
been through together,

87
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,429
you guys won't even
help me freeze myself!

88
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:36,418
Principal Victoria, we are
a devout Catholic family!

89
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,055
Do you mind telling me why my daughter
now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!

90
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:43,524
I told you this would happen, didn't I?!

91
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:45,421
Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-

92
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:49,752
We have worked years to instill the
teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter,

93
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:53,130
and in one fell swoop, you try
to destroy everything we did!

94
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,056
I hear ya.

95
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:57,037
Sir, if you don't wish your
daughter to learn about evolution,

96
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,656
then we can pull her out of class.

97
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:00,121
You most certainly will!

98
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:02,259
But Dad, I want to learn everything.

99
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,751
No you don't! Shut up!

100
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:08,828
Well, I told you. We should leave
evolution out of the classrooms.

101
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,287
It has become obvious to me
that you don't know enough

102
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:15,664
about evolution to teach it! I'm
having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins!

103
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,328
Re-replaced??

104
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:20,965
Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned
evolutionary scientist.

105
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,676
Charmed to meet you. Ms...

106
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:27,355
Shut up, faggot! Principal
Victoria, I can teach my own class!

107
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:31,416
You are to sit in class and help
Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!

108
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:40,048
Over billions of years life has
evolved from simple one-celled organisms

109
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:43,610
into all the complex
life we see around us.

110
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,216
Whatever.

111
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:48,016
It was changes in hereditary traits

112
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,856
that allowed the first
mammals to breath in the air.

113
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,768
Retarded fish-frogs.

114
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:56,065
Ms. Garrision, I believe that's
a gross over-simplification.

115
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:57,799
Well, you're a faggot!

116
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,257
Continue.

117
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:04,079
You see, children, life has the
amazing ability to change, to adapt.

118
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,974
Like changing us to the
point that we walk upright.

119
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:10,065
So you are saying that
we're all related to monkeys.

120
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,987
Well yes, basically, we are.

121
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:13,730
Do you see monkeys at the zoo?!

122
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,271
They crap in their hands
and throw it at people!

123
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:20,211
Ms. Garrison, this isn't
theory, it is scientific fact!

124
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,517
What about the fact that
if I believe in this crap,

125
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:24,054
you're gonna go to hell?!

126
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:25,695
Doesn't that bother you a little?

127
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,774
Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.

128
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:33,640
AHA! I've got you, you snake
in the grass!! I found you out!!

129
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,503
I never covered it up.

130
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:39,107
And if I'm a monkey, then I might
as well act like a monkey, huh?!

131
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:43,975
What on earth are you doing??

132
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:46,711
Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!!

133
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:48,229
AAAH!

134
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:53,671
Principal Victoria, I was simply
trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins

135
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,374
about the incongruity of
some scientific statements.

136
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:59,043
Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling
you out of the classroom.

137
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,052
What??

138
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,137
Principal Victoria, I really
don't think that's necessary.

139
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:09,879
This woman is very opinionated but,
she does care about her students.

140
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:16,386
Very well. But there is to be no
more throwing of feces. Understood??

141
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,896
Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could
I have a word with you, please?

142
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:22,827
What?!

143
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:25,640
Look, I know you think we're at war,

144
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,141
but I want you to know
I admire your passion.

145
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,707
You d-you do?

146
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:35,996
I've never met a woman
with so much... fire

147
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:40,165
Well I... I do bring down a
woman's wrath now and again.

148
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:44,036
So much boldness in
a woman. So beautiful.

149
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,460
I'm sorry, I'm sure you
have a husband, but I-

150
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,739
No! N-no! My, my
husband is g-gone, dead.

151
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:53,485
Would you then... consider
having dinner with me tonight?

152
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:57,956
Well, well, I suppose we could
have a little steak or something.

153
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:04,580
I've got a date! I've got a date!

154
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,106
My first real date with a real
man since my sex-change operation!

155
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,261
Oh boy, what'll I wear?!

156
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:12,903
Hey everybody!

157
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:24,844
Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!

158
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:26,595
Eric, get out of there.

159
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:28,384
No! No, it's too soon!

160
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,438
Now Eric, this has gone far enough!

161
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:33,177
You need to learn to be patient!

162
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:37,466
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.

163
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:38,965
Go where?

164
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:40,786
You're gonna help me freeze myself.

165
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,235
Okay.

166
00:09:55,363 --> 00:09:57,809
Well, how come we've gotta
come all the way out here?

167
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,630
Butters, if anyone else
comes upon my frozen body,

168
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,059
they'll try to unfreeze me right away.

169
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,366
I have to be hidden.

170
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,276
That's good.

171
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:09,331
And no matter what happens, Butters,

172
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:12,468
you are not to unfreeze me until the day
the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!

173
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:14,736
Eric, are are you sure
this is a good idea?

174
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:17,671
No, it's not a good
idea. It's an awesome idea

175
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:20,251
Yeah...I guess it is...

176
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,611
All right, you got the spot figured out?

177
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:23,135
You're not gonna lose where I am, right?

178
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,802
I got it. Big Tree. Oval Rock.

179
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:26,850
All right, now get out of here.

180
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,670
You can't freeze too, or
else we're both screwed.

181
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:34,568
Get out of here, you asshole!
You're gonna ruin everything!

182
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,781
Oh jeez!

183
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,756
Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.

184
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:49,047
So I told my gynecologist,

185
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:52,874
<i>you put so many things in my
vagina, maybe I should charge you!</i>

186
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:58,455
Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most
outspoken woman I have ever met!

187
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:00,833
It's almost like you're one of the guys.

188
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,837
Hehyeah, almost.

189
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:06,021
You have so much spunk, so much life...

190
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:08,494
If only you were an atheist.

191
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:14,381
Well... Well, you know,
I'm... I'm open to stuff.

192
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:18,860
Why is someone as outspoken as you given
themselves over to the whole God thing?

193
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,538
Oh I'm not... I'm not totally
into the whole God thing. I just...

194
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:26,989
I just think, you know,
you can't disprove God.

195
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:29,840
Well what if I told you there
was a flying spaghetti monster:

196
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,102
Would you believe it simply
because it can't be disproven?

197
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:39,276
You're riiight. It's so simple!
God is a spaghetti monster.

198
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:42,372
Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened!

199
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:44,617
Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!

200
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:47,764
Really?? Oh that's wonderful!

201
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:52,634
No, I totally get it now!
Evolution explains everything!

202
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,153
There is no great mystery to life,

203
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,981
just evolution and God's
a spaghetti monster!

204
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,688
Thank you, Richard!

205
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:00,461
You're so welcome!

206
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:02,423
Would you like tuh...

207
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:05,008
head over to my place for dessert?

208
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:10,788
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey!

209
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,776
Give this monkey what she wants!

210
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:14,216
Oh Ms. Garrison!

211
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,631
Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard!

212
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,683
Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!

213
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:34,975
Nin-ten-do. I'm coming.
I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.

214
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,325
We have a pulse.

215
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,216
Can you... understand me?

216
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,233
Where am I?

217
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:20,515
My name is Shvek. You are safe.

218
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,675
Safe where, butthole?!

219
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:26,608
My friend, this is going to
be a bit of a shock, but..

220
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:29,855
it is the year 2546.

221
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:31,868
What??

222
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:35,965
You have been frozen in
ice for over 500 years.

223
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,886
Butters? Butters, you black asshole?!

224
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:47,252
Please be careful. You are frail.

225
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,335
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?

226
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:55,463
Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive
gaming device used in his time.

227
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:58,596
Primitive? It has motion-control
controllers, asswipe!

228
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,697
Young man, you don't seem to understand.

229
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:04,487
Your family, your
friends, everyone you knew,

230
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,087
has been dead for over 500 years.

231
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,796
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!

232
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,562
We don't play videogames in our time.

233
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:16,411
There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.

234
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,146
No...

235
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,478
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

236
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:27,220
You must understand, children,

237
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,214
that we are dealing with
VERY large numbers here.

238
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,546
That's my man.

239
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:34,959
So, evolution doesn't
even happen by chance.

240
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,128
It is, in fact, bound to happen.

241
00:15:37,128 --> 00:15:41,559
That's right, kids. And so
you see, there is no God.

242
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,461
Careful darling. The school
board doesn't like it when we-

243
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:45,772
Well there could still be a god.

244
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,461
What?!

245
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:50,248
Couldn't evolution be the answer
to how and not the answer to why?

246
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:55,183
Uh oh, retard alert!
Retard alert, class!

247
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:58,292
Do you believe in a flying
spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!

248
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,058
I wasn't talking about spaghetti.

249
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:03,402
Come on, you. You're gonna
have to sit in the dunce chair!

250
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:18,367
Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what
you did in class today was right.

251
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,553
What??

252
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:24,066
But Dick, you told me the world would
be a better place without religion.

253
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,917
Yes, but to be so bold about it..

254
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:32,464
I've just never seen a
woman with such... balls.

255
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:37,125
You've just been too soft on
religious people in the past.

256
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,981
Think about it, Richard.

257
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:44,508
With your intellect and my balls, we
can change the future of the world.

258
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:47,055
Can you imagine a
world with no religion?

259
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:51,252
No Muslims killing Jews, no
Christians bombing abortion clinics.

260
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:55,861
The world would be a
wonderful place... without God.

261
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,618
You're the smartest man on earth, Dick.

262
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,387
With me by your side,
there's no stopping you.

263
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:05,932
Oh, just let me see those
beautiful breasts again.

264
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:08,647
Oh, all right.

265
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:12,815
Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm.

266
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,979
OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!!

267
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:20,495
Quick, General Disarray!
Kill those superheroes!

268
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:21,704
Pehpew Pehpew!

269
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:26,262
Yes! Now the world shall feel the
wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!

270
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:26,950
Butters?

271
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,393
Butters, you haven't seen Eric
Cartman in the past few days, have you?

272
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,995
Who, me?

273
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:35,306
It's very importance,
Butters. He's missing.

274
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:37,138
You haven't seen or heard from him?

275
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:39,753
No ma'am.

276
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:41,452
Okay.

277
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:43,014
Come on, Professor Chaos!s

278
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:44,319
Let's destroy this anthill!

279
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,357
Geh-General Disarray, can I
ask you a scientific question?

280
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,342
Okay.

281
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:49,739
Well, um, can...

282
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:52,014
Can anything bad happen if
you completely freeze yourself

283
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:54,612
and then unfreeze
yourself three weeks later?

284
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,568
- ...Yeah.
- Well, like what?

285
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:59,814
..Like, you die.

286
00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:00,909
...Die??

287
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,306
Well yeah. If you freeze
your body, it means you die.

288
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:06,445
When you wake up three weeks later you
can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.

289
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,736
Oh hamburgers!!

290
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,760
Eric! Erihic!

291
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,557
You just left him here?!

292
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:16,116
Without a jacket or anything?!

293
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:17,434
He told me to!

294
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:18,842
He's dead for sure.

295
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:19,740
Wait!

296
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:23,242
It's all different.
Nothing's in the same place!

297
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:24,533
Oh my God...

298
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:27,159
Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!

299
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,641
Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!

300
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:29,659
We have to get out of here!

301
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:30,355
What??

302
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:32,157
Nobody is ever going to find his body.

303
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:34,729
You've got to never say anything
about this, do you understand?!

304
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,621
He's dead, and if they know you
had a hand in it, you'll go to jail!

305
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,684
But I just did what he told me!

306
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:40,991
Come on, we have to leave!!

307
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:42,554
Oh jumping Jesus!

308
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,845
This is terrible. Five
hundred years in the future.

309
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,330
Eric, I have good news for you.

310
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,781
We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.

311
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:02,641
What??

312
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,499
Really??

313
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:05,489
YES!! YES!!

314
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:06,773
It's rumored that there's one at

315
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:08,881
the Museum of Technology
at New New Hampshire.

316
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,340
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!

317
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,719
Well, there's just...

318
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:16,057
th-there's something
we need from you first.

319
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:21,065
You see, my young friend, you
were unfrozen for a reason.

320
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:23,559
Lots of people froze
themselves in cryogenic labs

321
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,625
and we don't unfreeze them.
But you... are special.

322
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,056
I know I'm special.
This isn't news to me.

323
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:32,854
You lived in a time when
a great event happened.

324
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:36,586
A glorious event that finally
made all religion obsolete.

325
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:40,351
Now, the entire world is atheist.

326
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:44,483
And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?

327
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,806
We believe that somebody
you knew in your time

328
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:51,615
was the person who first
started our wonderful group:

329
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:54,281
The Unified Atheist League.

330
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:55,283
Who?

331
00:19:57,212 --> 00:19:59,462
What in Science's name was that?!

332
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:10,146
Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!

333
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:12,455
Oh Science, help us!

334
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:16,838
Science damn you,
Unified Atheist League!

335
00:20:16,838 --> 00:20:17,801
Who are they??

336
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,584
The Alliance Atheists.
We're at war with them.

337
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,204
No!

338
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:33,571
Jesus Christ!

339
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:36,965
Hahahaha, you believe
in a supernatural being.

340
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:40,691
Oh my Science.

341
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,974
I'm just a little boy from the
past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.

342
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,194
Put me through to the
Allied Atheist Allegiance!

343
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:58,885
Onscreen.

344
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:01,528
Look, Allied Atheist Allegiance!

345
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,655
We have the time child!

346
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:07,880
Science damn you, United Atheist Alliance!

347
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,825
Now you see, foolish sea otters,
that we are the atheists in control!

348
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:15,859
It won't make a difference!

349
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:21,021
This is the dawning of the sea
otter! Know this, time child!

350
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:25,664
I shall smash your skull
like a clam on my tummy!

351
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:27,707
What??

352
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:33,767
Otters! The time has
come! Sound the nafferty!

353
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,640
The nafferty!

354
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:45,929
So, it begins!

355
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:46,767
A suivre ...
